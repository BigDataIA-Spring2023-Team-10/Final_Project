We came at 8:30 a.m. and seemed like the first customers of the day.  Ordered the St. Louis benedict (4 stars). 

We also ordered the Maw Maw's cajun breakfast (2 stars) to-go.  On the menu, it says bacon bits, shrimp, scrambled eggs, and rice.  My girlfriend doesn't eat pork so we asked for the Maw Maw's without the bacon bits.  When the food came out, there was sausage and chicken in it as well.  I asked to send it back to have it made without the pork, but was told that I would be charged, even though the menu didn't list those extra ingredients.  Waitress made no attempts to even try to accommodate.  Did I mention we were the only ones in the restaurant?  I mean, it would make a little more sense if the place was packed and kitchen was bustling.  Baffling customer service response for a place with 3K+ reviews and 4 stars. 

With so many good cajun restaurants in the area, no need to deal with this nonsense.",2018-02-23 22:53:25

We were greeted, seated, and served by people who possessed great attitudes. I ordered the 20oz steak paired with collard greens and garlic mashed potatoes. The potatoes were great. The greens weren't really seasoned to well and were kind of bland. The steak was cooked very nicely BUT the dry rub was a bit much. I was almost like it wasnt used to SEASON it but to COAT it and I ended up scraping alot of it off. I MAY BE WRONG, but upon my visit in July, I thought they served a bread and butter while you wait for entrees but that wasnt the case on this visit. ONCE AGAIN... I may have the restaurants mixed up. OVERALL, I enjoyed the meal and would definitely visit again.

One of us had the crab cake platter which was rated as excellent. I had the Taste of New Orleans which has Creole jambalaya, crawfish etouffee, red beans and rice with smoked sausage, a little bit of everything I like. It was good with all of the various items having the correct taste and texture expected. We got there before the usual dinner time so we were seated immediately. The decor is clean and usual for a place in New Orleans. We had our order taken quickly and the food arrived in a decent amount of time. The did not have the IPA beer we wanted but the waiter, Todd, gave us a good suggestion.
If you watch the dynamics of a business you can quickly figure out that the wait staff have on blue shirts while the ""bosses"" have a burnt orange colored shirt. Just kind of strange to have the demarcation out in the open like that.

oB402h7znH4MjdTKib2zZg,nDecuGTnqDgVpH1zUyP8EQ,ac1AeYqs8Z4_e2X5M3if2A,4,0,0,0,"I finally decided to write a review after watching the episode of Kitchen Nightmares featuring the restaurant. 

I have been here on three separate occasions, usually when I visit NOLA for Mardi Gras - the first time was Mardi Gras 2010, then 2011, and last summer in 2013. From my first time to my last time, the restaurant's decor is still the same: tacky-ish, wonky colored carnivale-esque clutter. Each time I've eaten there, it's always been in the front room by the bar (I can point out each seat I was in) so my best friend and I, who's eaten there with me on two of those occasions, question where the white walls went that Kitchen Nightmares supposedly renovated. Basically, the decor didn't stick. It may be a nightmare to look at (the decor), but it's part of the restaurant so it wasn't a loss in my opinion. Plus, some online articles I found stated that the show actually didn't do much to renovate to begin with (it is a reality show, after all - Oceana's particular episode didn't really break down the changes and glossed over it so if they did put much effort into it, they sure weren't showing it off like in other episodes with a Before/After segment).

The food has always been good to me each visit, but I am a) not an expert on food prep of any kind and b) a tourist. I'm sure this would discount my opinion to some, but it is still an opinion of a visitor that makes a point to go each time. On two occasions, I had ordered the char-grilled oysters (which I know is available everywhere and I'm sure there are better places too) and the blackened catfish. I have never had a complaint for either dish and I finish the order every time. On my last visit, I went with two self-confessed foodies and they loved it as well. Their portions are generous and their desserts are insanely large though I'm fairly positive those aren't made in-house.

I have deducted a star because though Kitchen Nightmares is a reality TV show, I don't doubt that there is a pest problem, which really does cause me concern. One of my biggest fears are cockroaches and the streets of NOLA sure have their fair share that I've seen first-hand, so if that portion of the segment holds ANY truth, then I would certainly hope they at least cleaned up their act because if I do catch sight of something on a trip, they will lose a loyal customer and future recommendations. The owners made for great comedy and I sure hope Rami was able to get his brother Moe to see the light in really fixing things up. 

Hmm, seems I started to review the show and not the restaurant.

In any case, we would return on our trips as long as the pest problem is taken care of. Creepy enough, my second trip was within months of the show's airing so it's likely I would have eaten ex-Executive Chef Damon's style, which is terrifying to think about. I'm going to find my happy place now....

Give them a shot! If you see the owners (I have yet to), talk to the nicer one just in to be safe.",2014-01-17 07:23:36

We started with a plate of oysters. Fresh and salty clean, the oysters hit the spot. 

My friend ordered jambalaya. She's a local and seemed happy with her dish.

My bf and I split an order of the blackened bayou duck. As per usual, he also ordered french fries on the side. (Secret: He is always ordering french fries on the side...it's almost an addiction.) Anyhow, the duck was completely satisfying. Of course, blackened anything is darned good, right? It's hard to get wrong. On the flip side, the fries were blah.

Oceana obviously gets a lot of traffic. There were lots of families and larger groups eating. The ambiance reminded me of local seafood joint meets Applebee's. Initially, our waiter was perfunctory and efficient. There was nothing to complain about: he just seemed busy. At a few wise cracks from us, he immediately relaxed and joined right in.

For us, the duck was the biggest hit. The oysters were wonderful, too, despite our preference for Pac NW oysters. 

So, 3.75 stars for food. Good, even better than good, but just not great.
4.25 stars for service. Once he warmed up, our waiter was outstanding.
3 stars for ambiance. While they can't help being packed and a family-style joint, it does take away from the dining experience just a bit.
Total: 3.66, which I'll round up to 4.

It seems that tourists and locals alike are fans of Oceana. Expect main street seafood done right.",2011-04-22 05:22:28

I had heard from several others in our hotel lobby that Oceana Grill (739 Conti Street) was a good place to experience authentic New Orleans cuisine. Plus, it was only a few minutes from our hotel and figured that would be a nice way to spend the evening.

We were impressed with everything here. I don't know a thing about Cajun food and didn't know what to expect, but it was really very good. Everyone recommended the jambalaya (not a surprise since we all heard this is THE dish get in New Orleans) and I can see why. It was great. Nicely spiced but not too over the top and filled with shrimp and Andouille sausage, which I'd never had before but really liked. In fact, I'm going to find a meat market on Bourbon Street and take several pounds with me back to Minnesota. I also had a delicious crab cake for an appetizer. It was nicely seasoned and fried just right, not too oily or over-breaded. You could taste the crab meat first and foremost.

The place was busy, but the staff was accommodating. Our waitress and hostess both were very friendly and we had the owner drop by our table and ask us if we were enjoying our meals. Everyone was very friendly and all of this, along with the good food, will bring me back next time I'm in Louisiana. 

The prices are not bad at all and are right on the mark with all the other establishments that we have frequented in New Orleans this week. We were so happy with our visit that we might just stop here for breakfast in the morning before heading back to Minneapolis tomorrow afternoon. 

I really liked Oceana and would definitely return here! Thanks for making our trip to NOLA a memorable one!",2014-11-12 21:16:15

I made sure to over tip Allison the bartender to make up what you lacked in professionalism. Just know if you come to this place and order a steak and ask for medium and send it back 3 times. RAMSEY isnt going to ask you if you would like something else instead. Hes going to tell you that you have to pay for it NO MATTER WHAT. He is also going to just throw your already sliced open steak back on the grill. If you know anything about steak this is A EPIC NO NO. Thanks RAMSEY for ruining my meal.

The waitress came to ask us for our drink orders, and didn't return with the drinks for approximately 15 minutes, and didn't even bring everyone's drinks. I had to wait another 15 minutes just to get a glass of water. A while after that, she eventually returns to take food orders. After at least 30 minutes of waiting for food to come out, someone brings our food, but there are 3 orders that are missing. So we have to wait another 15 minutes, then when we got tired of waiting we asked another server if he knew anything about where our food was.

This summer, my daughter and I spent 2 weeks sampling local foods in Biloxi and New Orleans and I got so tired and bored with the STANDARD FARE of fried/broiled/grilled alligator, shrimp, crab cakes, sausage, trout, catfish, raw oysters and Boudin Balls that a single meal at Oceana Grill made the trip worth it!  Hallelujah!

Wherever we ate the quintessential jambalaya and etouffee tasted the same and there was a marked absence of vegetables of any kind - no greens at all!  WHAT?  It seems that all restaurants shared the SAME recipes and the SAME chef!   I am not a fried-foodie so I thought at some point I would see a vegetable but nooooooooo, none , not one ............... until Oceana.   Hallelujah. praise & thanks!

At Oceana, the food looked the way food should - no fried crust - just food that LOOK good and tasted even better!  I ordered the ''Taste of New Orleans'' which sampled Creole jambalaya, craw fish etouffee, red beans & rice with smoked sausage and sauteed vegetables -  it did not disappoint at all.   Free at last - I ate my belly full!

My daughter ordered soft shell crab, Oceana's Famous Oysters and Oyster Rockefeller and we almost bit into our fingers!  Yep, it was THAT goooooodddddd!  Hmmmm, Hmmmm!, Hmmmm!   

I have NEVER had anything that good - talk about the smokiness of the sauce, the mild cheesy flavor - it hit every taste bud on my tongue!  Good Lawd Have is Mercy!

I rarely eat at these types of places in the quarter since there are so many other authentic dishes to be found outside of the quarter. However, my tourist friends preferred to eat in the quarter so I chose this place based on the reviews. In short, I was embarrassed. One friend ordered the ""award winning crab cakes"". I'd love to know what contest awarded them because they were NOT seasoned.  Two other friends ordered poboys. I've never seen a poboy this tiny, nor barely dressed.  I ordered the Greek salad with grilled shrimp. The shrimp were bland and this salad they call ""Greek"" was simply lettuce, two slices of tomato, and two slices of onion . NOT a Greek salad in my book.  And it filled up MAYBE 1/3 of the bowl it was in. As my friends ate, I waited 3 minutes to get some salad dressing before I had to get up and ask for some. Come one people give me a break. I left hungry.  

I was hesitant to eat at a place like this in the quarter, and now I know never to do that again. I'll be sure to take my friends out of that tourist trap where they don't know what southern cooking is, to a neighborhood place like uptown, mid-city, or the Bywater for some REAL damn food.  Or I'll just cook it myself.  As for the service, it was ok. Nothing to write home about. If it weren't for the average service, I'd give one star.",2015-07-29 04:25:03

In fact, I would say that this was the worst restaurant of all those we visited in New Orleans. I would go so far as say that our food we got at our hotel was better.

Anyway, I tried the Gator Tail Bites (half fried and half blackened), a dozen of their ""Famous"" Oceana's Oysters, and the Fried Oyster Po-Boy. Maybe I'm just not a fan of Gator Tail, but I didn't think it was anything special. If you're new to it, I definitely recommend skipping it since it's like chewy chicken.

The Oceana's Famous Oysters were by far the worst. There was barely any oyster and it was drowned in their butter sauce. It reminded me of what you might get at a Red Lobster.

The Po-Boy was decent, but not worth going there just for that. I tried 3 different Po-Boys and this was the best of the 3, but not by much.

Overall, we paid way too much for very mediocre food. If we ever come back to New Orleans, this is a place to skip.",2018-04-04 17:44:03

Not the warmest greeting at the door. We asked for a seat inside, though they also have a nice courtyard in the back. The ambiance was a little loud but that could have been just the parties that were having dinner that night. The atmosphere is nice with this red hue around you, sort of like you're in a club. They also have many clocks on the wall, each one showing time from a different city in the world (cool!).

Our server was really nice. We asked for no straws with our water and she paid attention to our request (yay!). She also gave us meal recommendations because their menu is quite large and, actually, so are their portions.

We ordered one of their specials, the red snapper pontchartrain. It was quite tasty. Especially the creamy sauce that covered it. The snapper had a blackened rub, it was nice and flaky. It also had shrimp in it which were well done. The was a side of yummy collard greens too. 

We followed this with dessert. Bread pudding with ice cream. It says a lot that the ice cream was nicer than the bread pudding. And the portion was so large that we couldn't finish it.

Upon walking in my first thought was ""tourist trap"". Do I still think it's a bit of a tourist trap... yes, but they do have some redeeming qualities. Our waiter was so incredibly sweet. I truly can't praise him enough. He truly knew the menu and how to make our experience at Oceana Grill the best it could possibly be.

No. Was I full when I left? Yes. I really enjoyed the red beans and rice. However, the smoked sausage was the strangest tasting sausage I've ever eaten. I took 3 bites and couldn't eat anymore of it. The jambalaya was ok... not my favorite, but simply ok. My friends each ordered fried samplers and raved about it. I'll take their word for it though. 

The decor, I felt was a bit obnoxious, and for me screamed TOURISTS! I felt genuinely bad for the staff having to wear the shirt and ties with the big ole Oceana Grill patch on them. Couldn't pay me to wear one of those.

We ordered the charbroiled oysters, their famous crab cakes, the pasta jambalaya and bread pudding for dessert.  I also got the Abita Andy Gator which apparently has something like 8% alcohol but you can't tell.  Here is the breakdown.

- Charbroiled Oysters - Even though they are not as big as the ones at ACME, I actually liked these better.  These ones were sitting in a butter sauce and not just baked like the ACME ones.  They give you a spork (yes a spork,  like the ones that you get at KFC) to eat them with which actually goes well when eating oysters.  The only drawback was that the bread it came with seamed stale
- Crab Cakes - You get 2 decent size crab cakes...tasty but I wouldn't say mind blowing
- Pasta Jambalaya - Pretty good..came with shrimp and alligator sausage.  It was a good change of pace from all that fried stuff and gumbo I had been eating.
- Beer - I really like the Abita Andy Gator.  It's got good flavor and is perfect for a hot day

Neat atmosphere, definitely inviting. Our waiter was very nice and very helpful with both making recommendations on our meals as well helping with slight menu modifications for my 8 and 4 year kids. 

We ordered the shrimp caesar side salad, the blackened catfish poboy, and the taste of New Orleans for dinner. The shrimp was delicious and seasoned well. The catfish was cooked beautifully and was better than the fish we'd had just a few days prior on the Florida coast. The taste of New Orleans was a combination of crawfish etouffe, creole jambalaya, sausage and red beans and rice which was also very good. A great dish when we can't decide what to get. 

To drink we ordered the Oceana-tini and the hurricane. They were both disappointing and very light on the alcohol.  Later my husband ordered the local beer Purple Haze and it was fantastic!! I have to see how we can get some here in Texas!

We ordered the house char-grilled oysters. The sauce on the oysters were mouthwatering. We also got the gumbo, which was 10 times better than my man's homemade version. It came with white rice. There was the salad with alligator. This was healthy and the alligator tasted fine. The tail was gross though. I don't recommend eating that part of the alligator.

Even gave us a complimentary Oceana Grill mug since it was Jazz Fest. Thing I didn't like: Crab Cakes. Although the server recommended the crab cakes, they didn't seem fresh and the crab vs filling content seemed off. I am used to blue crab but it seemed liked something else.

Entrance: The whole wait line is a bit of a joke and big PR stunt - think NYC LA nightclubs. We just walked in unbeknownst without waiting in line and they offered us a seat within 2 mins. Once we were seated upstairs, the entire dining room was EMPTY... like no one there. I aksed why there is a line outside if there are so many seats open... i didnt get an a straight answer (Shocking!!!!) 

Menu: ok so after unknowingly ""cheating"" the line, we ordered crab cakes, mardi gras pasta and their ""signature dish"" called oceana redfish. Waitress (who was pleasant) asked to add crawfish ends for another $5. Sure why not!!! 

Presentation and Taste: Within minutes I had another server drop off lukewarm  (read: pre made) crab cakes smothered in a very rich sauce. It was like sauce with some smushy $15 imitation crab like patty! Then came the pasta and their signature dish. Both were once again loaded with Sauce (LOADED). Pasta was box pasta boiled and sauce was a joke. Red fish was breaded and fried long time ago and served warm... not flaky at all!!!! Again..think quantity over quality..

Conclusion: stay the F away, they lure you in with the lines outside and fake business pics on yelp. Actual photos suck and has zero taste. After all was said and done, we spent  $100 for app, 2 entrees and 1 crappy margarita. Please do your homework and goto Frenchman st near Jackson Sq.

The doorman at our hotel said, ""Then you need to head straight to Oceana Grill."" So we headed into the French Quarter to find it. It did not disappoint and made a skeptic into a huge fan of this town's famous cuisine.

We started with the ""Famous Oceana Oysters,"" a creamy concoction - of course delicious. Followed by our first-ever gumbo - was yummy and made me want to have more gumbo the whole rest of our visit! Had the Creole Platter, which had jambalaya, red beans and rice and etouffe. We added the crawfish to it and it was the perfect first-timer's sampler from an iconic restaurant.  

As other reviews state, the physical space is really cool - we sat in an inside courtyard not visible from the street. We were seated right away on a fairly busy Friday evening, which to me says the place is organized and efficient. So it was kind of weird that it took half the meal to deliver the drinks that were ordered before the food. You would think they would want to sell as many drinks as possible, but we only had time for one each. I tried a hurricane and would say it was weak, at best.

The rest of the weekend people would ask us where we had dined and when I said ""Oceana Grill"" they would exclaim ""Oh, that's the BEST!!""  It was good, but hard to be the best in a town so full of extraordinary restaurants.",2016-02-26 03:05:04

Will cross Oceana off the list on our next visit.",2013-08-06 16:57:45

We ordered the gumbo, Cajun jambalaya pasta, fried shrimp po-boy, blackened chicken platter, and catfish lafouche. We expected the gumbo to be spicy; however, it did have balanced flavors and the shrimp wasn't overcooked. The Cajun jambalaya pasta was our favorite dish. The Creole sauce was creamy and the alligator sausage was a great accompaniment to the dish. The fried shrimp po-boy had a little more remoulade than to our liking. Nonetheless, the shrimp was crispy and not oily at all. The spice on the blackened chicken had a good level of heat and was served with jambalaya. The catfish lafouche was recommended to us by our server, Derrick. It was a great sample of the different tastes of New Orleans! The catfish and crawfish were so delicious together.

Oceana Grill is a great example.  This place averages more than 3 stars and gets 4 starts more often than any other number?  NO.  NOLA is for partying, I understand, but it is also supposed to be a great food city.  

I got an Oyster PoBoy, some gumbo and a salad.

The salad had some very sorry looking romaine,  If that lettuce came out of your crisper, in your fridge, you would throw it away.  Add a sorry slice (slice?) of tomato and some croutons from a box, and dressing from a bottle.  That's yer ""ceasar salad""

The gumbo was no better than a Kansan could make at home.  The broth was nothing special; the shrimp were small and cooked to mushiness.  Think about that: abusively cooked shrimp in LOUISIANA.  There were a couple ""pieces of crab"" which were just annoying hunks of shell.  

The PoBoy was merely average.  I think a sandwich with hot/warm contents shold have warm or grilled bread, not necessarily toasted, but not straight from the plastic bag either.  The oysters were just warm when I got it and since it only took about 5 minutes from when I ordered until I picked it up, they were probably not freshly cooked.

Finally, I am stunned that when the Tobasco factory is about 100 miles a way, New Orleans carry out does not put any kind of hot sauce with its fried carry out!!!  I am making allowances for the fact that I got carry out.  This food would have been meh, if I had stayed and eaten it there (although I would have had hot sauce at my disposal if I had stayed at the restaurant)

Again, I'm disappointed with the inflated rating; the food is just average.  Even worse is there truly is good cheap, 4 star food in this part of town. It makes me wonder if the raters who give this place 4 stars are writing their reviews before they are sober.",2013-11-18 00:37:35

The roll was nice and soft, chewy but not in a bad way. The gator was firm but not chewy as I am told it can be. The fried were fries, crispy nicely seasoned but nothing outstanding.

Sure enough, my meal should have been $13.50. The other 5 ladies checked their bills -- 4 of the 5 of them were also overcharged for between $.50 and $1.50. The restaurant did fix the problem and corrected all of our bills, saying the computer was having some issues.

In addition she continued to make flirtatious comments about one of the guys who would bring out the food. Due to all of this it was very difficult to even eat our food.

CJ4bNwZknk0Cumpwudv7EA,SAfNyiLVgPZzp_aGpXnfwg,ac1AeYqs8Z4_e2X5M3if2A,3,2,1,1,"I should copy and paste our review from Old NOLA Cookery because the same guy owns Oceana Grill, the food is identical and the same menu can be found at both. While a spattering of local cops told us to go to Old NOLA Cookery it was the front desk staff at the Courtyard Marriott told us we had to go here. It was a locals joint they said, and a place one could go to avoid tourists (we didn't see any locals here, rather than the ones working), just a ton of tourists. I think there's some kickback program going between the cops and hotels, which is smart business by Oceana and the OLDE. 

Regardless, I'd only come here late at night when the competition is closed. The food is  at par with chains you've likely been to like Copelands and Pappadeaux. The cajun pasta, étouffée and red beans and rice is similar here. This isn't the kind of place that's a destination restaurant. The reality, come here for Cajun after 10pm when the competition is closed and you have no other choice. That's when it's best. Meanwhile, you can expect friendly staff and goo service. It's a fun place to eat (whether at the bar, outside on the patio or inside the restaurant).

I've eaten here once and everything is a strong average, but don't expect great sides. The veggies taste like they are made in the microwave and the collard greens definitely stemmed from a can. We've had the blackened redfish here a few times (it's much cheaper than at competitors) but often overcooked. Don't, however, order the blackened gator. This was some of the worst gator we've eaten (and we've eaten it all over the South). Normally, gator is lean or the restaurant at least cuts the fat off. Half the gator they gave us was covered in fat. The cook came by and noticed it and brought us a new batch. The second wasn't much different. The quality was poor and shouldn't have been served. 

On the other hand, if you've never had Cajun before and have nothing to compare it to you'll likely rave about this place. However, if you've had good Cajun at home, expect average food here. The food is good, but if you flew into NOLA for the seafood, spend a bit more and get quality, top-notch Cajun. You'll save a few bucks here, but give up flavor.",2015-10-19 00:27:07

First off, when you walk in, the entrance way has foul smelling odor. I know it's close to bourbon but you all can clean up. The oceana oysters are nothing like chargrilled oysters-even the picture on menu is misleading. The gumbo was bland. Crab cakes had more breading than crab & were so think, still had a hint of frozen taste to them. The BBQ shrimp were soupy. The only thing our party of 10 liked was the fried seafood & the creme brûlée.

I had the cajun jambalaya pasta, added blackened crawfish, and it was delicious. I think I can recommend anything blackened here: great flavor! The pasta was overcooked which was sad (ugg, soggy pasta). But the slightly spicy sauce and meats of the pasta were close in making up for it. The flavor was so good! The baguette slices were surprisingly delicious - perhaps a hint of the garlic butter used when cooking the oysters? I assume the bread was toasted on the same grill.

Fried eggplant was okay but a bit more mushy and underspiced than I'd like. I think Royal House still has the best fried eggplant.

I tasted the veggie pasta and the fried catfish and both are decent. Fries here are great :) Good, spicy hushpuppies.

Yummy chocolate cake; decent ice cream cake.

Sazerac: not sure how I feel about it. Very boozy, but still pretty smooth. I winced with every sip. You should be aware though that I'm not usually a fan of any whisky. ymmv.

I ordered a Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and my boyfriend got the Crawfish Fettuccine. Both dishes came out in large portions and were flavorful. I was hoping that the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta would have more of a kick to it, but it didn't, it had a more of a tomato based alfredo sauce.

I got the special, tuna stuffed with crab cake.  Sounds delicious, but my tuna tasted rotten in the first bite, so fishy I instantly, and instinctively, got the feeling I shouldn't keep going because this clearly could give me food poisoning, ok... be brave, keep trying (I really want to enjoy my first meal in the French quarter), second bite wasn't as rotten fishy.... but what the, what's all the sinew like strings I'm trying to cut through?  Try the other end, same issue, I can't even get a clean piece of tuna cut from this sinew stringy mess.  This was clearly the tail end of some lower grade tuna that was starting to turn.

Waitress, she'd get a 5 star, she was very kind.  The disgusted meal didn't effect her tip, it wasn't her fault.  

Manager that took his sweet time to come see the crap I was served, he would get 0 stars.  He was so short, curt, and inhospitable.  His lack of care for this customer is probably why I'd decided to leave a review.  I'm sure he doesn't care anyway.

My husband asked for the bill, minus my meal, which was inedible.  He told the waitress to get us our bill, minus my meal.  

The crab cakes and oceanas famous oysters are fine, but nothing to write home about, and not all they are hyped up to be.   

I'm very sincerely worried I may end up sick from the few bites of rotten tuna I ate, it's only been a couple hours since eating and I have felt queazy since.  SMH.",2016-05-21 05:07:50

Firstly they seated our group of four at the back of the restaurant which would have been fine with me except our table was partially positioned underneath the counter for the oyster bar. It was also extremely wobbly. We tried to remedy this by putting a pile of folded napkins underneath the part that lifted off the ground but it didn't make a difference so we asked to be moved to a nearby table which was done immediately. I then ordered the crab cakes and a side Caesar salad for my main dish since I didn't feel like eating a large quantity of food. The food came out in good time and my salad which I ordered without cheese was delicious. The crab cakes were a good size and tasted ok. The crawfish sauce wasn't as tasty as I had expected based on the other reviews I had read here on yelp so I ended up just picking out the crab and leaving most of it on the plate.

We ordered both their raw and grilled oysters, both blackened and plain Redfish, gumbo and a Ceasar. Oh, and a side of fried oysters for 4 of us. The only thing that was par was the Ceasar. The raw oysters were transplants to smaller shells and were not fresh-shucked (dead giveaway-no liquid and stale taste); the fried oysters were over- breaded with a harsh, hot cocktail sauce and the Blackened Redfish was dry,dry,dry.

After others in my group did tons of research to find the best places to eat  I found this place on a forum where someone spoke about their recent trip.

Conveniently located in the French quarter and there was no wait to be seated on a Thurs night.  Started with the oysters and crabcakes both of which were delicious.  I went with the fried seafood platter which was also good and my friends went with the Grilled Tuna ""La Boheme"" with barbecue shrimp.  The waitress was extremely nice and quickly brought us over our free refills.

Apparently Oceana doesn't take reservations on the weekend, UNLESS you call Monday-Friday to make them. When we arrived the line was about half a block deep. The guy in front said they only waited 30 minutes (Saturday night). We thought he was joking, but sure enough we were at the front of the line within 30 minutes. Good job NOLA lets people drink in the streets. However when we did get to the front of the line, we did get passed up by other parties of 2s, 4s, 5s & even 6s due to us having a party of 8. We asked why we kept being passed up. I spoke w/ a couple managers about it because we were waiting an additional 15-20 minutes AT the front of the line. Finally we were seated.

The inside of the restaurant def has a Bourbon Street vibe. Neon lights in the front, darker in the restaurant. Packing people in as best they can. We ordered a few apps. The world famous Louisiana Crabmeat Cakes (Served with crawfish and mushroom cream sauce) & Gator Tail Bites (Marinated white meat gator tail served fried or blackened. Served with remoulade sauce) (blackened & traditional). All 3 of these were AWESOME. As we started to order dinner we did see 2 of the staff members bringing down a toilet, YES A TOLIET, that had a hole in it from upstairs. Mind you there is a bathroom downstairs. Not too appealing in the middle of a dinner rush on a Saturday night.

When dinner arrived the following was ordered by the group:
Redfish Oceana (Sauteed redfish topped with our own crawfish mushroom cream sauce. Served with roasted garlic potatoes and sauteed vegetables) - Very happy w/ their order
Blackened Bayou Duck (Smoked till it's tender then blackened and topped with a crawfish mushroom cream sauce) - The duck was a bit dry, the sauce was very good though
""Knife and Fork"" B.B.Q. Ribs (Slow cooked, fall-off-the-bone pork ribs. Served with coleslaw and French fries) Very happy w/ their order
Seafood Gumbo - said they have had better

Overall the team thought the place was 'ok'. The original wait time to be seated put a sour taste in our mouth. The food & drinks changed it, especially the crabcakes.

The oysters, raw and grilled were good but you could get these anywhere. The crab cakes and catfish po boy drowned in this buttery fat sauce. The biggest disappointment was my entree, the blackened duck. it's a shame when the vegetables are the highlight of my meal. Duck is a beautiful and delicious bird, but this was dry, overcooked and salty. C'mon guys for about $20, you can do better.

One surprise was our server. At the end of our meal, he wrote down a list of bars to try that were off the beaten path. We checked some of these places the next day and didn't let us down. 

Overrated. The food served here is an insult to cajun cooking. The crime here is that the warm and friendly waitstaff can't carry this place.

We normally go and check out a place of Yelp before we go, but with Oceana we went the extra mile and checked out the menu as well. When their online menu differed from what they have as a menu now, they were understanding and accommodating and went as far as to add something that was no longer on the menu  back on so I could try it for the first time. I had alligator bites which they now only offer blackened, fried. They were to die for! If you've never tried it, it is well worth it. And don't even get me started on the gumbo.

David recommended that we start with the Oysters Oceana, since the restaurant is known for their sauces, and hummmm diggity those things are goooooodddddd. They were so tasty that we ordered another platter of them. I don't even care for oysters really, but I had to sample them. Man... they were so good! They are baked and are bathed in a delicious, creamy sauce. Included on the plate are a few slices of french banquette. Dip one of those babies in the sauce, and your tastebuds with be on Cloud 9. I dream of having that dish again. Truly I do. I literally wanted to lick that plate clean, but since I'm a classy broad I had to refrain. 

Next up, five dishes in total: Two orders of Gumbo, crab cake fettuccini, blackened chicken fettuccini, and crab cakes with greens and potatoes. Everyone was very pleased with their menu choices, and cleaned their plates. Compliments over and over again to the Chef. 

Lastly, dessert was up. Bananas Foster was the choice, and it was a remake of the original. This one was more of a bananas foster ice cream cake. Cool creamy vanilla with banana on top of a sweet buttery crust, and all topped with whipped cream. Delectable.

They wanted to check with their hotel concierge for recommendations.  The concierge walked around from the desk, grabbed my friend's arm, and practically marched us over to Oceana Grill, which was across the street.   The aggressive marketing (and what I can only assume are kickbacks to hotel staff) set a bad tone for the meal -- how good can a restaurant be if they have to try that hard?

One couple in our group ordered an appetizer of fried eggplant that was tasty, although I recommend skipping the blend of ketchup and mayonnaise that they served as a sauce.  (Ask if they have a marinara.) 

I ordered ""Redfish Amer"" ($18), which was pan-fried redfish smothered in a creamy crawfish sauce.  I grew up on the gulf coast, where we used to catch our own redfish.  I can only assume the redfish in my dinner (if it was indeed redfish) was farm-raised.  At first bite, I thought it was catfish -- it tasted like the bottom of a lake!  The crawfish sauce was bland almost to the point of being tasteless.  It was like hollandaise with no lemon, with some chewy red bits of meat thrown in.

Several people at our table ordered the ""Taste of New Orleans"" ($16), which was a trio of Crawfish Etoufee, Red Beans and Rice, and Jambalaya.  The jambalaya had a pleasant spiciness, but the rice was a little gummy and the sausage was a little rubbery.  This was the first time I've had jambalaya, and I would have to try it at a better restaurant before I passed final judgment.  The etoufee was bland but passable.  Is it possible that they used canned beans for the red beans and rice?  I'm just not sure.

On the plus side, we had a group of nine and we were seated immediately.  We had some picky children eaters with us, but they had a kid's menu if you asked -- Chicken fingers or fried shrimp or fried cheese sticks (each served with fries) for $5.  The mixed drinks were $6 and served in large schooners.  The service, while not superb, was adequate - no complaints there.   The prices, which seemed a little high at first blush, may not be too far out of line for a touristy restaurant  just off Bourbon Street.  Portions were large -- a couple could easily share an appetizer and one entree and fill up.",2007-07-02 06:44:24

My friend and I ordered the crab cakes as appetizers. This dish comes with 2 pieces of crab cakes topped with crawfish tails and cream sauce on a thin bed of Romaine lettuce. Each piece of crab cakes contains a lot of real crab meat inside. The outer crust of these crab cakes is crunchy which adds to the joy of each bite.

My main course was the Grilled Ahi Tuna ""La Boheme"" with bbq shrimp toppings. The tuna slab that came was huge and I chose to have it cooked medium rare which came out just great. A small plate of steamed vegetables and garlic potatoes in a sea of melted butter also comes with this dish. The only negative side of this dish is that it was lacking flavor for both the sauce on the tuna and the bbq shrimp. This was quite a disappointment considering the crab cakes appetizers made us think the main course would at least keep the bar as high.

My friend had the Redfish Oceana, which was fried crusted redfish topped with crawfish cream sauce. This dish also comes with a small plate of steamed vegetables and garlic potatoes in melted butter.

And I've had a lot!! My second favorite is the Cajun Jambalaya and also loved the taste of New Orleans is perfect, add some Louisiana hot sauce if you like more spice like I do, the they have the best by far Shrimp Po boy- large shrimp with yummy cole slaw, make sure you try at least a cup of Gumbo (again I always add some hot sauce for an added zip, yum yum) and don't forget to try the Catfish Lafouche it's amazing - I asked for extra cream sauce, just because I could, holy cow loved it...even the Charbroiled Oysters come with their infamous sauce on them ( I don't even like oysters, yet, I loved these!!) then dessert each time was spectacular which was the home made cheesecake home made bread pudding and best for last, the home made foster banana ice cream cake, to die for!! Seriously no need to go anywhere else if you want Creole/Cajun food!! We tried other places and we keep coming back here!!

For dessert I had the New Orleans bread pudding. This may be my favorite dish for the entire trip. It was decadent.

We specifically made sure to ask, 'there is silverware, correct?' We were reassured there was silverware. The delivery guy left and we found no silverware or napkins. It's a little difficult to eat pasta without silverware. We called back and very nicely let them know we didn't get the silverware or napkins. We were told it would be on its way. Long story short and multiple calls later, we finally received a new pasta dish and silverware. This process was almost 3 hours long. The delivery person had our hotel front desk call our room  and ask if we would come down and get the food. No. She came up and delivered the food clearly irritated that she was asked to bring it to our room. She then said  that her manager wanted the uneaten food back.

I came here because of the reviews and they serve food late night. Our first choice was Deanie's, but they close early. It is right off the Bourbon street. We came in sat down, ordered gumbo which was pretty tasty, however the oysters sucked. I'm a big fan of the oysters, so I ordered half dozen raw, half dozen Rockefeller, and half dozen house grilled. The half dozen raw was fresh and taste, but the Rockefeller and the house frilled were very bad. It tasted like they had picked all the unfresh ones and decided to hide the unfreshness with loads of sauce. Rockefeller didn't even taste right with bunch of soggy spinach on top, house grilled ones were drown in this creamy cheese white sauce and it was gross. You can Barely taste the garlic they had described it on the menu. The Rockefeller I had at Deanie's were MUCH better.

We sat at the bar and Shaun immediately greeted us and let us know that he was there to make sure we enjoyed our visit. He was friendly, super cool and knows his way around a bar. My friend and I both decided to get a Platter and after telling Shaun what I wanted, he suggested the Ultimate Platter which would give us everything we wanted and save us a couple of dollars. I found that to be so cool. The food came and everything was good. Our platters consisted of Fried catfish, shrimp, softshell crab and crawfish. You are able to add fried crawfish or softshell crab to any platter a la cart. We aldo decided to try a few drinks. I had the Tropical Storm and my friend had the Tidal Wave.

I'm not sure if the courtyard will be bearable in a month, but it was great on a mild May evening.

My husband and I have dined at Oceana's sister restaurant The Alpine (see my review for details), and the menu is very similar, but the atmosphere is completely different.  Oceana felt more like a dive/sports bar than anything else, and The Alpine is a more romantic place with candles on the tables etc.  

Service was great.  Our sweet waitress accidentally brought my mom-in-law and me the wrong wine, but she took it right back and brought us the right one immediately.  She was quick to refill our waters, and our food came out in record time.

It wasn't the to-go cups of alcohol (maybe the alcohol a little...).  And it darn sure wasn't the work trip I was on. My purpose for coming to New Orleans was to eat at Oceana Grill.

Nothing can really beat walking down a crowded street in a new city, taking in the sights, the sounds... good Lord the sounds... and stumbling into a restaurant with food so enticing, so delectable, so savory. Oceana Grill, or Old Nawlins' Cookery as the kitsch sign says, is steps off of Bourbon Street on Conti, where the crowds thin and the aroma of Creole happiness wafts down the block. The decor is comfy, happy, a little touristy and completely appropriate for serious grubbing. 

If I can entice any Yelpers out there to order one dish, it's the Taste of New Orleans. The crab cake pasta and the shrimp creole were big hits at our table, but let's get serious. If you can't make up your mind, and you feel like extanding your stomach to unknown reaches, get the Taste of New Orleans. It isn't a pretty dish, with most of the offerings blending together into a big soupy bowl of burnt terracotta brown, but don't be scared away. It is the best tasting bowl of terracotta-colored food this side of the Mississippi. 

Red beans and rice with smoky pork, spicy crawfish etouffee, shrimp jambalaya and a large piece of smoked sausage are all topped off with two slices of garlicy, buttery bread, begging to be dredged through the sea of spice and succulence. 

Seroiusly, does that not sound like the most heavenly meal ever? Stop it, it does and it's amazing. My party of four split the bananas foster ice cream cake (because we weren't feeling fat enough...) and it was fantastic. Gooey and sweet with multiple toppings and tons of flavor.

Oceana Grill was my favorite meal in New Orleans for a lot of reasons. The reasonable prices, polite staff, irresistable food and convenient location make it a huge winner in my Tourist Goes to NOLA handbook.",2012-03-06 21:02:25

However, when the tummy is empty, it calls out, regardless of what it just went through!

So we decided to give Oceana a shot, since it was walking distance from our hotel, should things go terribly awry.

First of all, the greeting we got was friendly and immediate. No dawdling around the front door, wondering where to go. I like that. Next, our server, Tyler, was the biggest charmer in Nawlins, and pretty much had us wrapped around his finger by the end of our meal! 

We started with fresh oysters, which were the cheapest, biggest, and freshest ones we'd had in a loooong time! They were yummy and HUGE! Then I got the grilled ahi tuna ""La Boheme"" which was the biggest piece of sushi grade tuna, seared to my request, and topped with yummy shrimp in a delicious sauce! Mmmm... the potatoes were yummy, too! My sweetie got the Cajum jambalaya pasta, which had alligator sausage in it, and he devoured it entirely! I tried some of his shrimp and the flavor was yummy, spicy goodness....

My favorite part of it all, though, was the Kentucky bourbon pecan pie that we got a slice of at the end.... I've never been in love with a dessert like I was with that slice of pie! Mmmm.... SO PERFECT! The pecans tasted buttery, yet crunchy, the filling was a perfect balance of sweet and rich nuttiness.... I want MORE!! I'd go back just for that pie!

We wanted to take our waiter home with us so we could hang out and be charmed some more, and if he had a pecan pie with him, well, I don't know WHAT would happen, but it would be all kinds of Nawlins naughtiness, I can guarantee you THAT!!

Here's what we got:
Eggplant Sticks--good and fairly crisp. The remoulade sauce was pretty tasty. 
Crabcake Appetizer--Drunk at 4am, these would be delicious. Not drunk, they didn't taste any more special than something from the frozen food section at your local grocery. 
Gumbo--I'm not a gumbo fan, but it was edible.
Blackened Shrimp Salad--the blackening seasoning used on the shrimp was super salty, but pretty good. The shrimp had a nice texture, and my taste test companion said the Cesar dressing was delicious. 
Fried Catfish w/french fries and Hushpuppies--Catfish with breading were chewy. Tartar sauce was disgusting--warm with a funky after taste. French fries were something you could definitely buy in the frozen foods section at the local grocery. Hushpuppies were so hard throughout they might have been fried yesterday. 

There is a fine line between attentive service and stalking. The waitstaff and managers hovered. I worry when restaurants do this, because it makes me think they are trying to see if they've gotten away with serving subpar food.

Overall amazing experience from the friendly staff, fast service to incredible food. Started with the Hurricane drink and the crabmeat cakes -- now I know why they said it was the most popular appetizer. For dinner I had the Mardi Gras Pasta -- to die for! I cleaned the plate :) Our server was CJ and he provided outstanding customer service and was a pleasure to have as our waiter. I know when I return to NOLA in the future for a longer stay, I will definitely be back here again. I wish I made room for dessert, because they all looked to die for too.

The hostess was very pleasant. She explained the menus and advised where the facilities were located. Our waitress arrived a few minutes later. She was very friendly and had a great personality.

She came over and took our drink order. A few minutes later she was back. We placed our entire order. We had the alligator bites for an appetizer, small Caesar salad, cup of gumbo, taste of New Orleans and the cajun jambalaya.

The alligator bites came out first. We chose to get half fried and half grilled. I personally preferred the grilled bites but they both were very good just a bit chewy. 

Wifey had the cup of gumbo. She said it was absolutely delicious and I had the Caesar salad. By the time the entrees were preparing to come out we were full. We chose to have them packed up to go.

We didn't eat that evening but warmed it up the next day in the hotel. I was a bit skeptical about how it would taste but it came out amazing.
The Cajun jambalaya was ""slap your momma"" good and wifey thoroughly enjoyed the taste of New Orleans. She stated the ""flavors are to die for"".

I would highly recommend this restaurant if visiting New Orleans. This is my 3rd visit here and one of my top restaurants to visit and the prices are very reasonable. This place will not disappoint. Good service, atmosphere and food.

It came out in a big bowl with two delicious pieces of bread sticking out of the sides like carb-y icebergs. Small strips of zucchini and yellow squash were drowning in a pile of noodles and an alfredo-ish sauce.

The poached egg on the crab cake benedict was perfect. Once you cut through it, the egg yolk oozes out. The English muffin was also nicely toasted. The crab cake portion was tasty but got a bit too salty as I progressed through it. 

My friend's crawfish omelette wendall was a pretty large omelette. She said there was a lot of crawfish though there were two that looked a little old. The egg was pretty fluffy.

Service 3/5: a bit slow, the waiter who served our table wasn't very friendly at the beginning, he ignored our table and served another large group seated way much later than us, though he explained in the end he didn't know we got in first because of shift change, anyway the manager on duty was super nice and very patient

Food 5/5: overall great taste, awesome food selections, and you have to save some room for desserts 
  Louisiana Crabmeat Cakes - *** served with crawfish and mushroom cream sauce, though it's marked as ""most popular appetizer"", I think it's lack of crab meat and too salty 
  Oyster Rockefeller - ***** the classic sauce with spinach, smoked bacon and pernod liqueur, topped with a blend of fresh grated parmesan cheese, heavenly delicious, highly recommend
  Oceana's Famous Oysters - ***** freshly shucked Louisiana Oysters on the half-shell, chargrilled over and open flame, smothered with unique zesty garlic and cream herb cajun sauce, finished with a fresh blend of parmesan and romano cheeses, another heaven taste, so I suggest you do half rockefeller and half oceana's, highly recommend
  Redfish Oceana - *** signature dish. sauteed redfish topped with own crawfish mushroom cream sauce, served with roasted garlic potatoes and vegetables, the fish was very fresh, however too thick and flavorless inside
  Taste of New Orleans - **** Creole jambalaya, crawfish etouffee, red beans and rice with smoked sausage, rich in flavors, recommend
  New Orleans Bread Pudding - ***** served with famous praline and rum sauce, though I wasn't happy with the service initially, I have to say the bread pudding here made my day and became happier with every single bite, highly recommend

 So I stagger up to the bar and my friend tells me he's ordered some food. I'm expecting some potato skins or buffalo wings. NO. How about a 1/2 rack of BBQ ribs, New Orleans BBQ shrimp ( Big -ass Gulf Shrimp), Crab cakes & a dozen oysters on the half shell? What's better? THE TASTE:
 
The Ribs were tender and smothered in a good amount of BBQ sauce. The New Orleans BBQ shrimp aren't actually ""barbecued"", just terminology. It's actually simmered in a light tomato based sauce drenched in garlic, oregano & rosemary. Can you say DELICIOUS? Plus they give you some french bread to slop up the extra sauce... The crab cakes were something else too...2 HUGE crab cakes, the size of a midgets fist, smothered in a creamy creole garlic shrimp sauce...GOT DAMN!!! The oysters were indeed fresh and... well... oysters are oysters! They've also got the local brew (Abita) on tap. 

We also met some great people who came down from Shreveport, LA for New Years and they raved about the food...the girl sitting next to me had the Fried Shrimp Po' Boy and said that was one of the reasons she came down to NOLA for New Years! Her boyfriend was a crack up, he also bought me an Abita beer! I also ran into a writer for a Hawaii newspaper that had lunch here the day before and said he had to eat here again before going back to Honolulu. 

I would have never guessed I was eating this quality of food at 3 am at a bar. A fancy seafood restaurant in the French Market, maybe but not in some bar & grill in an alley off of Bourbon St.!!! I'd love to come back to this place before I die.",2008-01-07 13:15:55

Crab cakes (their specialty)
Catfish po-boy

The crab cakes are excellent; very tender and chunky. The crawfish cream sauce is rich and makes a nice complement.

The catfish po-boy was good. The catfish wasn't too thick and the fish-to-batter ratio was right on the money.

My family had:
Blackened ahi tuna
Blackened chicken
Gator bites
Barbecue shrimp
Soft-shell crab

Both the tuna and chicken were cooked perfectly and the blackened seasoning was very robust and wasn't too salty. The gator bites were very chewy and not very enjoyable. The shrimp was okay, they're grilled and drenched in their own style of BBQ sauce, nothing special. The crab was good and tasy, but nothing worth noting.

We also shared gumbo, which was very tasty; did not have an overwhelming seafood taste. Just wish they could've been a little more generous with the rice.

Also worth mentioning their Cajun fries are awesome.

The food was quite delicious. We had 1/2 dozen oysters, blackened chicken, and blackened bayou duck. The oysters were fresh and yummy. My boyfriend said his chicken was delicious!! And my duck was fantastic. It's a different style of cooking duck than I'm used to, but the duck was tender and full of flavor for the blackened spices.  Finished off with the chocolate Kalua mouse cake. It was good, but not much Kahlua flavor detected.  Also, my boyfriend got a double shot gin &tonic, and let me tell you, they are NOT short changing you. It was definitely a double! Yummy!

After getting back to my hotel, I found that the gator bites were missing. The gumbo was okay but nothing you cant get better elsewhere. The crab meat cakes stated they were supposed to come with a crawfish mushroom sauce which was missing as well. Therefore the crab cakes were a little dry and flavorless. The shrimp platter was also not great. Lastly, the bourbon pecan pie slice was very small and the whipped cream was spoiled.

I usually never eat oysters but we got the oyster Rockefeller, and all I can say is...Wow. same with the catfish po-boy. I thought it would taste weird with the Coleslaw but I can assure you that the flavors (the fried catfish, pickles, coleslaw, cheese, and bread) all meshed together extraordinarily. The BBQ shrimp was also stellar. I'm not used to having to peel shrimp before I eat them at restaurants but it was all worth the work. It was a little messy, but the flavors had cooked into the shrimp.

The service was pretty good, although she took kind of long to get our order despite it being pretty dead in the lunch section. She made for it later in our stay by being more attentive even when it got a lot busier.

Lastly, I thought the facility was very unique. Granted, this was my first New Orleans trip ever so all of the houses (which this facility basically is situated in) in New Orleans are really unique to me. But anywho...loved the decor.

They top it with the usual lettuce, tomato and pickle and remoulade sauce but they add cole slaw which makes the sandwich incredible. And of course it comes with Cajun fries. It's not cheap ($14 for a sandwich) but not much is in the French Quarter and it is definitely worth it. And it is convenient right off Bourbon and open til 1AM.

My dining companion and I decided to split two appetizers, the Gator Tail Bites and a dozen Oysters on the Half Shell along with a Shrimp Po Boy between the two of us for a nice snack.  The gator bites and oysters came out at the same time and both looked fantastic.  The oysters were meaty and served over ice with crackers while the gator tails were blackened with remoulade.  Both appetizers tasted wonderful with the gator tails having a good flavor and spice that married wonderfully with the remoulade and the oysters were fresh and tasty.  Shortly after we finished the appetizers our Po Boy came out with cole slaw, pickles and a remoulade on it.  It did not disappoint either and had lots of great flavors.

We enjoyed the platter and was back the next day for lunch. I don't remember the name of the waiter (probably John) but he didn't seem to carr much. Thinking of our platter the previous day, we ordered a blackened catfish platter, thinking it would be enough for 2. When it arrived, it was just a big fillet with 2 sides, enough for just 1 person. He never even told us that it would not be enough for two. We also had a creme brulee.

My husband got the jambalaya pasta. It was SWIMMING in grease. Two of my daughters got chicken Alfredo to split. It was also extremely greasy and a very small portion. The packaging was terrible. Flimsy styrofoam containers for a pricy meal is too bad. The containers were all crushed when we got them. The grease from the pasta dishes was EVERYWHERE. The girl that took my order on the phone was rude. They only take exact change cash as payment. I was told 45 minutes for delivery. It was an hour and fifteen minutes before it arrived.

The crab cake pasta was mediocre - creamy and buttery, the crab cake was typical, but nothing amazing or extra ordinary. This was our favorite of the three dishes. 

The blackened redfish was pretty good. A little over cooked and almost dry in my opinion, but nothing a squeeze of lemon couldn't help. Jambalaya wasn't bad, but greens were not delicious. 

The crawfish fettuccini was sadly terrible. I couldn't stand it anymore after one bite - the pasta was overwhelmingly fishy due to the fishy, horrible quality crawfish.. I was looking forward to this dish but it ruined my appetite.

The food was, as aforementioned, phenomenal. We had the crab cakes(which I loved), gumbo (my brother thought was only standard) catfish special (blackened) fettuccine alfredo with blackened shrimp and breaded chicken(a delicious unique twist to your ordinary Alfredo). The entries were such flavorful dishes with great texture. The fettuccine alfredo sauce was cooked with shrimp and crawfish and a mixture of veggies giving it a very rich flavor. The catfish special and the crab cakes were adorned with crunchy baby shrimp and were amazing. Whatever the sauce was...it may have been the same....I would bottle up and take home to put on everything, sriracha style. Seriously delicious. I recommended these dishes to new friends from the bar the night before and they were equally pleased. Though we only tried a small handful of items, based on our experience and the feedback of our new friends, this is a place where you can't go wrong.",2015-02-20 22:46:15

X4XNW9KCzZ4vrsvjgdckJw,v9BuMJg_LxUPFbLnmY8dBA,ac1AeYqs8Z4_e2X5M3if2A,4,4,2,2,"Funny thing is that our group came at 11:30PM on a Sunday (I know we're that group) and when we got there the server made remarks that their food tastes better to go. haha. We were initially going to order to-go but they informed us that oysters cannot be ordered for take out. Luckily for us, the other waitress inside agreed to seat us even though it was 11:45PM. THANK YOU. This quick instant showed them going above and beyond and was much appreciated. 

Located on Bourbon street I can see how the tourists flock to this place, but after taking a Lyft our driver even recommended it so it's definitely a place for both masses. 

WHAT TO GET: 

+ Crab Cakes - The order comes with 2 huge cakes. The cakes are filled with crab and doesn't have an overwhelming mayo/breading taste. They pair it with a crawfish/mushroom cream sauce that is filling but not too overwhelming. 

+ Famous Oysters - the zesty garlic and cream herb cajun sauce was soooo good. Probs my fave of the meal. We also ordered the fries that had the same sauce and it tasted just as good. The oysters here are also a decent size, but I only wish they were cleaned out a little better. 

+ Gator Bites - When people say that gator tastes like chicken it totally does. haha. The blackened and fried bites were moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. They had a nice flavoring in their breading and wasn't too salty. 

+ Ribs - Fall off the bone! If you want a change from all the seafood this is a great option. The ribs are tender and they add just the right amount of sauce to give you the rib experience without all the mess. 

Overall, our waiter was awesome and was really accommodating even though he was probably wanting to clock out more. We also found something in our dish and they quickly brought out the manager and even comped the dish for us.

It was about 2pm; there was no wait at all, so we were seated right away. My friend and I were both pretty full but we definitely didn't want to miss out on the opportunity to try some alligator bites!
We got the Alligator Bites - half fried and half blackened ($13). After about 10 minutes or so, they were at our table.
Honestly, it tastes like chewier chicken, but it was great! I enjoyed the fried alligator more than the blackened, so I'd definitely do that one only next time.

The oysters were a real stand-out, and this is coming from someone who isn't an oyster fan.

The turtle soup is definitely worth a try. It's tangy and sweet, and the meat is really good.

I'm a New Orleans local and have been coming here for a while.  Even though it's a tourist trap, they have good food and usually decent service... 

If you can't time your food correctly when it's busy, don't seat so many people. I've seen this time and time again at many restaurants, and it's the fatal balance of pleasing customers while still turning tables.  This place tonight did not get it right. 

Our appetizers were walked around the room for 10 mins before finding our way to our table... Even after our waiter almost dropped it off and then decided it wasn't for us.  When we finally got our cold oysters, they came by with our main courses about 2 minutes later and copped an attitude when we refused.  They said they'd remake them.  They didn't. When they arrived later we could all tell they had been set aside. From the wilted French fries to the barely warm crab cakes. These babies weren't even under a heat lamp.  

They did take a few bucks off the bill, which was why this is 3 stars instead of less.

Yeah, true story, although I didn't yelp about my prior dining experience at Oceana this was actually a return trip for me.  Which must be saying something, like:
Wow Mike you have a really bad memory and forgot to yelp ,
Thought you were the real thing, you're a phony... a big fat phony , or
Great food, forgetful yelper, still equals great food.

Personally, I'm going with the latter, because the food really is amazing.  I'm pretty sure my first trip was a po boy, but since I can't remember for sure I'll just speak to this most recent trip.  Of course.  And on this one I went with the Fried Shrimp Platter.

Oceana is a great location, just mere feet from Bourbon, but not directly on it so it may be possible to lose a bit of the crowd.  When you walk inside it appears rather small, but it's smoke and mirrors, because on the other side of the wall and host stand is a lot more space with a lot more tables!  

We had a small group of 3, and were very quickly seated.  It took a few extra moments for our drink orders to be taken, but once that started the ball kept rolling and refills were even quick/timely.

We had the fried gator bites as a starter, which were a little tough (expected after having them before) but still very good and well seasoned.  Even the picky eater ate at least 3 of them... and enjoyed them!  My shrimp plate was HUGE, but so delicious.  While the shrimp were fried, the way they were battered and cooked to perfection made them feel so light for a lunch.  Each bite was fantastic!  The fries, were... well... fries, but if nothing else they were well cooked.  No over cooked, soggy, or spongy undercooked in the batch and still tasty.  

As I've returned now, I'll return again.  Oceana Grill is a great place to grab a bite and so far everything has been delicious, so I don't have a reason to stop going!",2012-11-15 16:14:51

nlvYTv_lsJDJ3_4qciyk8w,rc_GiGGxmHAJWjV8RBOIZQ,ac1AeYqs8Z4_e2X5M3if2A,5,0,0,0,"For a restaurant located just off of Bourbon Street, in the heart of the French Quarter, I was not expecting much.  This place does not have the pompous un-earned airs of Napoleons or the expense account needed to attend of a Brennan's family offering, instead it offers a great meal, at normal pricing with friendly waiters who do not shove you out the door when you are done.  

I am allergic to shellfish, which, in most towns is normally just a pain.  In New Orleans, it is limiting.  The two times we ate here, the wait staff verified with the cooking staff that the item I ordered (Red Beans and Rice) would be cooked contaminant free.  Both waiters took the time to point out other menu options available for me in case I did not want the red beans and rice but felt they were a ""safe"" option - trust me, the wait staff here is a among the best in the quarter!  My friends had the crab cakes: now, since the shellfish is an adult allergy, I was howling jealous.  The appetizer was two generous cakes of 95% crabmeat with a stunning crawfish sauce. The red beans and rice was outstanding.  It was not served as a sauce over white rice but as a dish, as it should be.  The hurricanes were good (ok, probably not the best in the area but I had just arrived into town and was just leaving town!) and lacked the overly sweet taste that seems to be pervading the area in the post-Katrina rebuild.

Oceana's drawback during popular times is that it does not take reservations.  You can line up or arrive early/off times.  They do a brunch and there is an ATM on site.  There is a courtyard in the back.  They are just off Bourbon so you can avoid that mess if you like and we saw several families having lunch as they do seem to contain the party scene to the front area.  With places like Oceana Grill, I'd skip the higher end places: here is where you can get the same food, for lower prices and frankly, better ambience.",2010-04-05 19:59:52

Upon entering, you kind of feel like you're walking into a Bubba Gumps which is why I'm giving it 3 instead of 4 stars. You know, the chain seafood sorta feel, tvs screening their commercials, menus with pictures of the food, etc. Not my ideal dinner spot. But for what it was, it was good.

We were seated upstairs in a big exposed brick room (actually pretty cool) and service was GREAT. Super attentive, friendly waiters - they clearly had a well-polished system which made the experience seamless.

I ordered the Jambalaya Pasta which was pretty good. Not at all spicy, but flavorful with chunks of chicken and shrimp. Again, kinda reminded me of something I might get at a Sizzlers..

If you're a tourist and don't care about the ""chain-y"" feel, Oceana is definitely a good option. If you perhaps have more refined tastes or are looking for something a bit more unique.. perhaps keep wandering.",2015-02-20 00:27:52

I forgot the exact names of the things we ordered but they were some specials our waiter had recommended. Everything about this place screams New Orleans, for a tourist it hits all the things you'd want to experience in a typical NOLA dinner place. 

Had my first Bloody Mary here and although it's not my cup of tea it definitely was good. The drink itself almost felt like a meal, I couldn't finish the fish dish I had ordered despite it being delicious. The crab cakes were amazing! I honestly didn't think I'd be so full after having just one, but maybe it was due to eating so much food in general vacationing in the city. 

The only bad thing I can say is that our server was not very attentive. Nice guy, idk if it was really busy and they were understaffed, but he wasn't around much. I have strong empathy for waiters because I used to be one, so I tend to be less critical about it. But there are some standards a waiter has to abide by, and asking for refills and waiting to ask for the check def brought the experience down. If the service woulda been on point I could've rated this closer to 5 stars.

It was extortionately expensive and we bailed.  After roaming, we came across Oceana.  

The beers are inexpensive and the food is delicious.  We started with oysters on the half shell and grilled oysters (Oceana's Famous).  These were crazy delicious.  The grilled were better than the raw.  The latter were plump, but mild and needed cocktail sauce/lemon/horseradish.  The former were perfectly seasoned.  

The wife and I both had the red fish special entree.  It was blackened red fish with jalapeño and shrimp sauce that contained some breading.  It was like stuffing.  The server said it was her favorite and really good.  She was right about that.  Our friend ordered the crab cakes.  She fortunately wasn't able to finish them all and I got to eat one the next day.

Anyway, ordered $200 worth of food online specifically for delivery and was called 10 minutes before the scheduled delivery time to ask when I would be picking it up.  Ummm...I think you meant when will you be delivering it to me, Oceana.  Were told by an employee that our food was nearly finished and were we on our way to pick it up. Got on the phone with a manager who said that our food hadn't even been begun.  I have a feeling the order came in, they started cooking and then checked the delivery and realized they weren't willing to deliver.  Had a lot of ridiculous back and forth with the manager about how we weren't in their delivery zone (again, definitely in the French Quarter) and that corporate doesn't like when employees drive to drop off deliveries.  Does corporate also have a problem with people driving to work? Because I'm sure that's how your employees get to work.  Pro Tip 1: don't offer delivery if you aren't willing to drive. Asked if we could pay an additional charge to have the food delivered outside their zone.  Also a no-go.  Asked if we could meet them where their delivery zone ended and were told that they've done that before and they could never find the people who ordered the food.  Um, it's pretty obvious Oceana...the people you're looking for are the hungry ones looking for you so they can pay you for their order. It really isn't that difficult which leads me to Pro Tip 2: invest in some technology that doesn't allow people to put addresses in your website that you don't deliver to (even though you ought to because GEOGRAPHY states I'm in the French Quarter).",2015-11-08 00:52:31

We were lured as Super Bowl visitors by our Baltimore Ravens flagship radio station 98 Rock being broadcast here, and the atmosphere was definitely cool, we will give it that much.  But that's where the goodness stopped for us.

I think our poor experience started right at the door.  There was a long line, and we kept seeing people walk up to the front of the line, say something to the hostess and she'd put her arm out to cut off the people waiting in line and gesture for the line-cutters to go ahead in.  Maybe they had a reservation or there was a private party going on, and that is totally cool, but when we asked why they were being let in, we were ignored.  Guess we weren't dressed well enough.  But for someone who drove 18 hours to get there, I thought I looked pretty good, but I was sooo hungry, I just wanted to get in and eat ravenously so I tried not to care.

So we were finally seated- albeit, right next to the kitchen, and of course we were going to give it a look, I mean the door was swinging open a lot, so we might as well.... and we were pretty disgusted with what we saw.  The floor was disgustingly dirty, crap was all over the walls, and the cooks didn't look very clean either.

Though again we tried to look past it, we weren't at all surprised when our food came out tasting pretty terrible.  The po' boy bread was hard and soggy at the same time (definitely frozen, then microwaved), and covered in bagged lettuce (looked like the stuff that Subway uses).  The tuna special was legitimately HARD all around the edges.  Had to cut them off with a KNIFE like I was a kid who didn't like crust on my sandwiches!

One of the things i like to do when I travel for business is ask various locals I encounter as to where some of their favorite eateries they dine at or where locals will dine at.  4 different people directed me to this place and said this is more authentic then any other place in the French Quarter when it comes to New Orleans cuisines. 

Started off with the Oysters Rockefeller.  This was okay and had a lot of flavor but was mostly full of Parmesan than actual oyster.

I proceeded to the deep fried combo which came with catfish, shrimp, oysters, and I substituted the jambalaya with craw fish etoufee.   All of this was very good and had the right kick.  

The bottom line is the price was right, the portions were good size and the service was great.  Would recommend this a a place to go to for an easy dinner or lunch.",2012-09-22 18:01:19

We were trying to find a place to eat before starting the barhopping, and my girlfriend was eager to revisit this place after a year or so, because she loved the BBQ Shrimp here.
Even on a weekend, in the party center, of NEW ORLEANS, we were seated in five minutes. They brought out drinks really fast and always made sure we were doing fine. We ordered half a dozen oysters, the BBQ Shrimp and the Jambalaya Pasta, and I must say, they nailed everything!

This weekend we had our meals and 7 people paid their tabs but for some reason one card went missing and the waiter said he never gave it to her. We all clearly saw him place his card in the thing and she even dropped his card once and he picked it up and gave it back to her. When she came back saying he never gave the card she said she had to talk to the owner. Now out of the other 6 couples this guy was by himself and had a tab of $21 compared to our $89-$90 tabs the couples had. Ours was paid his wasn't. The owner came back and talked to him and said basically he had to figure out a way to pay. Now the principle of all this obviously wasn't that we couldn't pick up the tab for him but the fact that she lost the card and out of courtesy the owner could have said hey we're sorry let's us make it up to you by not charging for a $21 tab. It was our fault we lost your card. Needless to say the owner even went to check the camera and indeed he had given her his card. For some reason he kept trying to pull our friend to the side without all of us being able to hear or see what they were talking about. While we were standing their waiting he screamed out loud to another manager ""don't let them walk out"" as if we didn't want to pay. Even though we had all spent at least $500 and paid already. At the end he rudely screamed at us and told us he was going to call the cops if we didn't pay. Again the principal wasn't that we couldn't pay it was that it was their mistake and they should have owned up to it. Eventually we paid his tab but only because it was ridiculous how they were being with all of us. We walked out furious and you guys definately lost our future business. 

Oh BTW about 30 minutes later after we had blocked his card someone was trying to use it on bourbon st. We really think our waiter took the card or something because she didn't go to far to run our cards for the rest of us.",2018-04-18 04:14:12

We were greeted by Jamal,  he was amazingly attentive but not overbearing.   The hostess brought us our drinks and in  less than a minute, there was Jamal.  He told us about the specials and gave us some time to decide.  
He came back and we ordered blackened alligator and another corona.    I've never tried alligator but when the runner brought it out, Jamal came around right after we tried the first bite; he was asking what we thought, if we needed anything else, etc...i digress, the food was VERY GOOD, seasoned nicely with a nice consistency. It has the same sort of texture as chicken (what doesn't though?). It was so good dipped in the sauce that is presented with it. This was a spicy blend of flavors - Cajun dipping sauce ?hhahaha 
I ordered the blackened Ahi tuna medium rare, stuffed with crawfish with a creamy sauce, creamed corn, red beans and rice and of course, jambalaya.   Holy cow!! It was delicious.  For dinner we finished with the creme brûlée- this was my favorite.  It was perfect.

I visited Oceana Grill while on vacation in New Orleans. I made an online reservation for 9pm and arrived approximately 5-10 minutes prior. As I approached the restaurant, there was a line of about 15 people waiting outside. I notified the hostess, whom was standing outside about my reservation. She then told me to go inside and notify the hostess at the hostess counter. There were about 10 people in the ""waiting area"" at the front of the restaurant, so it was a bit packed. The hostess who was standing outside then comes in and rudely tells everyone to get out of the way and move to the side. She then told the other hostess about my reservation, in which she rudely replies, ""they need to go back outside and wait in line."" If there was no available table at that moment, that should have been stated. There was no need for a rude dismissal. Anywho, we decided to leave at that point.

I must say the oysters on the half shell were great and shucked perfectly!  Too bad that doesn't count though since I can get those at about 1000 places in New Orleans.  The fried gator bites were pretty tasty, but the shrimp poboy was a let down.  The fried shrimp weren't that good, and the batter was not complementary at all.  It was too thick, and you couldn't even taste the shrimp.  I've tried other dishes there too, including their friend oysters, and none have left me with much to be excited about.

We were recently married in New Orleans and were in need of a rehearsal dinner space, Oceana made it a hit. 
All of our guests LOVED the food, atmosphere and staff !!! Many of our party returned to Oceana throughout their stay due to the amazing service and delicious food. Our family planned the wedding from Austin, Tx and Kayleigh was a great help with all of our needs while organizing the dinner. She made this a breeze, they stayed within our budget needs and accommodated our party of 52 with no hiccups at all. Kim was our head waitress. Kim and her team brought a smile to everyones face. She had my grandfather rolling with laughter all night, my nephew was so taken with her he asked if we could all take a picture together. All of the food came out hot, in a timely manner, everyone was served all at once and when we had 2 very late arrivals within 10 minutes of our guests being there they had drinks and food as if they didnt miss a beat. We decided on a sit down meal that included a option of beverage, starter, entree and dessert. All of which were delightful.  We'd visited Oceana before for lunch and dinner and loved the food and very friendly service. This experience takes the cake though. The rehearsal dinner at Oceana was one of the best parts of the wedding week. ALL of the guests remarked how much fun they had, how adorable and true to the area the space was, how stupendous the staff was.  We will definitely be back and will use them for future events as well.

Blackened Alligator Tail Bites - 2/5. Unfortunately, this was deemed a miss. The seasoning was very well done (italian style seasoning), but it overpowered the taste of the alligator.

Fresh Oysters - 3/5. Standard oysters served with the standard lemons, saltines, and cocktail sauce / horseradish on the side.

Fried Seafood Platter - 3/5. Fried oysters, friend shrimp, fried catfish and fries. Not much to go wrong here as it's a bunch of fried foods. The fried catfish definitely stood out since the soft fish meat contrasted with the crunchy, battered exterior.

Crab Cake - 3/5. Delicious crawfish and mushroom cream sauce complimented the soft crabmeat.

Bread Pudding - 2/5. Firm bread pudding that didn't have the soft melt-in-your-mouth texture that I desired. However, it was prepared with raisins (a pleasant surprise!)",2013-04-18 18:53:34

I really should have followed my intuition and stuck around the CBD since there are cleaner and more upscale restaurants there.  My main issue with this restaurant is the ambiance is not relaxing, the food was about average and the vents were blowing down cool air conditioning on us the whole time so even though it was in the low 60's here the temperature of this place was in the low 50's and everyone dining here was cold and had to keep their coats on.  It's not very relaxing to eat when it's winter time in the french Quarter and some cold air conditioning is blowing hard down your backs as you are waiting on your order of food.  This place is just not for me.  I prefer smaller, more intimate bistro settings and this place was super casual, chilly and served food that was not that spectacular.  I guess I felt bad since I encouraged my friend to take me here and found out it was nothing special.  I don't understand why this place is getting such high ratings but I do travel quite a bit and I have been to some very wonderful restaurants were ambiance and food quality are well above average.  I would never recommend this place to anyone.  Stick to the grapevine, Mr. B's or any restaurant in the CBD.  This place is noisy, chilly and the food a huge disappointment.",2014-12-28 05:48:31

I would recommend coming to this place in between heavy drinking, which seems to be every night on bourbon st haha. The place is enormous and all but has a very 'Casual dining chain' feel such as an Applebees, TGIF Friday's, Red Lobster etc. I don't normally frequent these kinds of places and in my serving days I remember exactly how things were prepared. Most of the food items were pre-packaged and frozen, over salted and fried and down right stale at some points. 

We somehow managed to come here twice during our stay this past weekend but both times left me feeling regretful.

The seafood gumbo included slightly under cooked rice, stale Italian bread and HARD shell crab chunks. OUCH!!! :(   (meanwhile, their menu HAS soft shell crab listed..........I'll get to that later)

My friend ordered the lump crab meat and NO WHERE on the menu did it mention coming topped with a sauce that included mushrooms bits, which btw she is allergic to!

I ordered the Soft shell crab which NO WHERE on the menu did it mention being fried. I literally only managed to eat about a quarter of the soft shell crab since most of it was FRIED GUNK! EW. 

The mash potatoes were edible and the drinks were tasty. Our server the first time around was very friendly and recommended several places to visit. Our server the second time around clearly had better things to do.",2015-04-20 16:53:35

Tried our luck, and the hostess asked if we're okay sitting in the courtyard - Duh!  We're from New York, we'll take any opportunity to eat in an open space with fresh air :-D

Anyways, so right after we are seated, our server brings the menu, water etc... so 5-stars for service... And then while we're still discussing, he suggests we order their raw oysters right away... We did as told and then also ordered a platter of fried shrimp... 

Overall, great food and flavor, the oysters tasted fresh and great.

We had the Pecan pie with ice-cream for dessert, and nothing was left sticking on the plate (or its sides )

So I'll preface this review that I am from California. In California it's illegal to smoke within 20 feet of a business door and thus when we were seated for our first meal (we returned a second time the food was so good) on the patio, we were shocked that every single person on the patio was smoking.

Beware, if you're seated in the patio, someone will probably be smoking.

Now, on with the review. Both visits we had the crab cakes and bread pudding. The bread pudding was amazing, sheer bliss. It made the top 5 of the items I tried while in New Orleans. The crab cakes themselves were filling, delicious, and savory. An entire meal really.

We didn't repeat the fried crab I ordered on our first visit (incredibly tiny, and generally not worth the price), but both times our service was friendly and warm.

Tried to be healthy by ordering the Redfish Oceana, but it was a battered fish, not really sautéed. The cream sauce was tasty though because there were little crawfish pieces in it. Nothing terribly special about this 'signature dish'.

Lastly, we ordered a seafood gumbo. This dish was probably the best of the three. It was basic, seemed like a dish you can get anywhere without waiting in a line that is out the door.

She walked off to seat another couple. Male hostess comes to ""seat"" us. He walks us into the room points to our table and tells us to go have a seat & he will bring us menus in a minute (he had menus in his hand). Needless to say he never brought us a menu. 10 minutes later waitress comes by to get drink order and then went to get us menus. Waitress Janette Z only came by to get drink order, food order & bring us the bill. She never checked about our drinks- yes our glasses were dry. The restaraunt was not busy & she only had 4 tables that were no more than 4 to a table. She was not present on the floor to check on any of her tables.

The alligator comes fried and blackened and I thought blackened had more flavor so that was fun to try. The RAW oysters were so much bigger than a lot of other places. The charred ones though had a different save than most but you got the smoky flavor from them and they were so good.

Surprisingly the fries and hush puppies are also delish and soft on the inside crispy on the outside. The New Orleans sampler was great and made me believe in beans and rice again as that was the most flavorful rice and beans I've ever had in my life!

(If you're looking for spices, you may have to asked them for a little extra). My brother had an Oyster Po'boy, fried crawfish and crawfish etoufee. He was very satisfied!
The restaurant is in the french quarter and close to everything, so it's a good stop on your way to party.

The second time around, I had the crab cakes. They were so big that, it's all I ordered. They were delicious! The best I've ever had!

A definite must do when in NOLa!!",2017-06-11 16:17:53

The Taste of New Orleans had the jambalaya and red beans and rice in one plate. And the oysters were to die for! 

My mom told our waiter that we were there for my birthday and they gave a free bread pudding dessert. Probably one of the best bread puddings I've had. It was served warm with a very soft inside and crunchy on the outside.

I had actually never come across a review for this spot while I was researching my eat-a-thon itinerary prior to my trip. While heading into the French Quarter one evening, I was lucky enough to be driven by a New Orleans native who highly recommended this spot and told me I absolutely had to try the crawfish cakes. Well, when in Rome...

As we walked to the door and stopped to check out the menu, an older couple stepped out with a contented sigh, saw us and remarked ""Just go in and eat. We come here every time we visit New Orleans, and this is by far our favourite spot"". As we were escourted in, we overheard another couple saying ""oh my gosh, that was the best meal I ever had"". Ok, now I'm practically drooling in anticipation.

Our server was incredibly attentive and oozed southern charm. He sat us right next to the kitchen, which is open concept and allowed us to view our food being made. I did get those crawfish cakes, and let me tell you, they melt in your mouth like butter. Not too strong on the fishy side, but not overwhelmingly spicy. Just the perfect balance of taste between the seafood and stuffing and spice. We also ordered the nightly special, the Ahi Tuna steak stuffed with crab meat, with a side of red beans and rice and jambalaya. The tuna was not overly fishy either, which I was concerned about, and had a firm texture, delicious with the light crabmeat filling. Overall, there was not a bite I took of that whole meal where I didn't make some sort of audible sound of contentment. At the end of the meal, the cook came out to take our plates and I complemented him on the food. He seemed genuinely thankful, and beemed at us as he returned to the kitchen, obviously taking pride in the food they serve.

This was definitely by far the best meal I had during my week stay pigging out on seafood, and I highly recommend it to anyone visiting the FQ. Not to be missed!",2011-03-03 02:36:40

I started off asking her opinion on the dish I should get in which she replied the oceana redfish . I decided against that after looking at the description and told her I'd just like a half dozen oysters and a side of étouffée. After a while I was wondering why my appetizer had yet to come out and soon found out it was because in her head she heard me say the red fish I guess . After I told her I didn't order the redfish I ordered the oysters she rudely replied well you didn't say that . From there of course it went down hill.

Soon as we sat, we were asked for our drinks, and it only took a few seconds for me to choose the Taste of New Orleans from the menu. My mom chose the Fried Shrimp and Fish. We were shocked when not long after ordering, the cook himself came out with our plates. The food was nice and hot. What mattered more to me was that it was also delicious. The Taste of New Orleans comes with Red Beans and Rice, Andouille Sausage, Shrimp Etouffee, Jambalaya and some French Bread slices. It was more than enough to share. There were three of us, and between the two plates, we could not eat it all. We gave to the doggie bag to my uncle on the way home. Excellent prices, excellent service, excellent quality and taste.

1st time. Maître Di greeted us as we walked in, and sat us down immediately. There are two dinning areas on the ground floor, one small dining area by the grill kitchen and the second area the larger dinning room. We sat by the grill-bar kitchen eating room. I liked it cause I could see how they grilled the oysters..dramatic !

Megan was our waitress, very attentive, she suggested a menu, after I told her I could not eat very spicy food. However, my wife could eat the spicy stuff. We started with Alligator Bites, they were good. Wife had Red beans with Rice and sausage, she loved it. I had the grilled Redflish, it was great with the vegetables. All good service, drinks a bit on the pricy side, for the 2 frozen daiquiris.

2nd time. No one at the Maître Di desk. Waited a while, a few minutes, lots of waiters at the bar, getting drinks, but no Maître De. Lady Maître Di, about 5 foot high, with large black head band, attended to the party of 6 who just walked in, and ignored my wife and I who sat at the bench in the lobby, waiting.  Then a lady applying for a job left the job application with the lady Maître Di. The Maître Di reviewed the job application, then a flower delivery guy stepped in and gave the lady Maître Di the flowers. Maître Di then opened up the card and read it, then left to deliver the flowers, did not see her again. Chris, the male Maître Di now enters the picture, sees me and asks if I am with the party of 6. I said no, we are just two, he immediately sat us at a table on the ground floor main large dinning room. Jamal was our waiter, he was attentive, stopped by several times, to check on how we were doing. He gave us a container to take home, cause my wife was unable to finish the large portions of the good seafood jambalaya pasta. I had a huge Ahi Tuna steak. The Ahi Tuna plate came with vegetables smothered in garlic. I love garlic, so it was good for me. All the food was delicious, including our dozen grilled Oysters. They were the best !.

So, it goes to show you, the Maître Di, can make the event great or leave not such a good impression.  Bottom line, the waiter staff was great, the food was great. A bit on the pricy side, but for a holiday, ok....",2013-06-28 21:50:32

This is the second time that I've visited Oceana, and they did not disappoint. I am not sure if this is authentic NOLA food (probably not), but I have thoroughly enjoyed the meals that I have had here. My last visit, I had shrimp and chicken alfredo (I asked for a side of shrimp), and I was no longer thinking of portion control. I was all about getting that pasta in ma bellllyyyyy. 

Atmosphere (4 out of 5)
Very loud, overly decorated, but somehow still charming. I enjoy being seated by the windows, where I like to think I people watch. In actuality, people actually watch me scarf down food.

Seating (2 out of 5)
This is the only part of this dining experience I do not necessarily enjoy. There's always a line to get into this restaurant. The wait can be anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes.

Most people don't order steak at a seafood restaurant but I'm so glad that we did. That steak had the most flavorful seasoning and I liked it better than the fish even though that was good also. 
Before we left, we both got a Big Banana which is a frozen drink consisting of banana cake, banana rum and vanilla vodka. OH MY BANANA! It is like the greatest adult milkshake ever and you can even keep the plastic glass it comes in. 
Because of my job I inquired about their banquet space and Caryl personally greeted me and Kayleigh was nice enough to show me around upstairs and we walked nearby to even more banquet space which included a balcony on Bourbon. This would be PERFECt for any corporate function or private party. These ladies were so professional and friendly that I can't wait for an opportunity to work with them.

Service is distinctly casual. You walk in off Conti past the bar - a long, narrow, boisterous place - to be seated.  Service is quite attentive and casual and friendly.  Sort of touristy but definitely local too. Lots of locals come here (I'm from Mid-City living in Houma now).

It's especially nice to go in for dessert on a Saturday afternoon after the lunch rush is over and just relax. Desserts are good:  bread pudding is good with a rum praline sauce.  Also the creme brulee and the bourbon pecah pie.  

But I'm getting ahead of myself.  The entrees are good too :-)

For an appetizer we had the alligator bites. We were able to have them prepared in 3 different ways. Fried, grilled, and blackened. It came with a really good side Cajun sauce that paired well with it. All three styles are really good, but for me personally I liked the fried and grilled the most. 

I also tried their famous fried shrimp po'boy with french fries on the side. By far the best I've ever had. They were a little light on the Cajun sauce in it, so I got some more on the side and it was amazing. The fries were extremely good too. I don't know how they cooked them, but they were really delicious. 

For dessert we tried the pecan pie. I thought I had some of the best before till I tried there's. The pie here is now on top of my list. The BEST I've ever had.

And the portions are HUGE - if you don't have a big appetite I recommend you order family style and share a few dishes. Our appetizers filled us up to the point where we (hubby and I) didn't even make a dent in our main meals. We felt terrible wasting food and didn't take it to go because we were going out to Bourbon Street that night and didn't want to carry around leftovers. Side note: Bourbon Street is literally around the corner from this place, like 2 steps away so it's very conveniently located if you want to hangout there after dinner. We came as a group of 21 people for our friends birthday dinner. They sat us in the upstairs middle level (I think they have 3 floors?) and we were able to sit together in a long connected table, which was nice. Most other places in NOLA will accommodate a group of our size but they usually split us up into separate tables. 

Of the 21 people, we paired up about 4 people to share dishes. My group got crab cakes and charbroiled oysters to share - both are appetizers. The charbroiled oysters were AMAZING. That in itself could've been a meal. I'll be dreaming about them forever. For my main I got the Mardi Gras pasta, which was sooooo heavy and creamy but so delicious. My hubby got the fried seafood platter (too fried for us, too hard to eat that much fried food). He barely made a dent in it. From what I remember some of my friends got po-boys and others got jambalaya and the blackend chicken etc. With such a large group I'm sure everyone ordered a variety of things off the menu. The menu is large enough that everyone found something to eat, even the one vegetarian friend we had. The birthday girl got a bread pudding which we all passed around and had a bite of - it was very good. We were all way too full to order separate desserts. The waiters brought out the bread pudding with a candle and we all sang to the birthday girl. 

Service was good, we had 2 waiters attending to us since we were such a large group. They were able to give our group separate checks so we didn't have to split the bill in the end, which was nice. Hubby and I got our own meals and group appetizers on our check. I liked this place a lot. Two thumbs up.",2017-08-23 19:21:52

Good solid 4 star place on Yelp.  I'm giving it 5 stars because it is AND to compensate for a few awful 1 star reviews. How can some tell the seafood was frozen? I am no expert but nothing we had tasted ""fishy"" which is, to me. my life long deciding point. The crab, shrimps, fried oysters were all premium to our palates. Gumbo, good to the last drop. Red beans and rice? Heavenly smokey taste and velvety smooth. This is not Popeye's. Fried oysters, superb! A hint of spicy breading, lots of them on more French fries that I can eat. We could not finish our portions.

Our waiter Val paid attention to our table, without being annoying, which is right on. He was pleasant, humorous. By the time we departed, after meeting management, it was all handshakes. Can't wait to go back.

I was told to try Oceanas because the seafood was really good. We arrive and there is a line. I was so happy with my position when I looked back and saw how long the line grew. We get in after about 20 minutes and I am amazed about how big this place is, with about 3 or 4 floors. The biggest hype for me was getting in the restaurant. Unfortunately, everything went down from there from the food to the service to my drink. After being seated we waited about 10 minutes to meet our waitress. She seemed nice but she must have been miss America because we hardly saw her. We put in our drink orders. I ""supposedly"" ordered a drink with patron and midori. I'm still waiting for the taste or even the smell of some sort of tequila. Definitely on the sweet side. My dad said his amber local beer was good. He describes it as a hybrid of Heineken and a Guinness stout. My mom said her dirty martini was made well. On to the food. We ordered appetizers, the alligator bites- half fried and half blackened, the smothered crab cakes, and seafood gumbo. We were told these were the restaurant staples. After about  45 minutes our food arrived. I believe now this was a sign to vacate the premises. I really wish I spared my taste buds at the appetizers. The alligator bites were ice cold so they remained on the plate. Fried was better, but that means absolutely nothing. The smothered crab cakes were also cold. It had a shrimp topping. Far from the best crab cakes I've ever eaten. They were basically a big tasteless ball of mush hardly filled with crab. The gumbo was a bowl of rice with gravy and a couple shrimp thrown in for decoration. This was the most unseasoned, tasteless gumbo I've ever eaten. We ordered one entree because we were still hungry but scared for the out come. We ordered the fried shrimp platter. Now, it is almost impossible to screw up fried food, but they definitely achieved the certificate for bad fried food. The shrimp had a heavy batter with no taste. The fries were bad. How do you  mess up a French fry. They were hard with some sort of coating on top. Did I mention they were also cold. The manager apologized and removed 2 dishes off the menu. Thank goodness we decided to have 1 entree. If you want to come to see what the hype is here all I can say is good for you. Definitely won't be back.

- Smoked bayou duck with crawfish mushroom cream sauce
- chargrilled oysters dusted w/ garlic and cream herb cajun sauce.
- raw oysters
- fried seafood platter with oyster shrimp catfish and crawfish tails
- bread pudding w praline and rum sauce

Service was on point and Jaime was very helpful and professional. I liked that I got a window seat overlooking the people snarfing their meals in the courtyard.

At this point I had cajun and fried foods for the past 2 meals and slowly getting sick of it, but I persevered and was determined to try the last one at this 3k yelp reviewed place.

The oysters came out first and as my brother and Jaime preferred raw, I demanded a dish of chargrilled bc we were here to get the taste of nola, not fresh oysters. The raw ones were gigantic and I am not a fan of big oysters, but they went down smooth only thanks to the special cocktail sauce with some grated parmesan? The chargrilled oysters totally killed the raw (for me) because it masked the oystery taste with a killer buttery creamy burnt cheesish taste and they were small.

The smoked bayou duck had a deep layered taste. The perfect crispy savory skin lead to the oil rich fatty layer that then led to the moist meat portion. Instantly I was on a boat on the bayou with my bass shop pro gear shooting ducks like that ancient game duck hunt. Needless to say this was a great dish, but some parts the fat was too overwhelming to swallow and drizzling down the sides of my mouth. The crawfish cream sauce went especially well with the duck as the sauciness added a slightly herbal veggie accent to the flavorful duck.

The seafood platter was exceptional as the fish was a soft but firm texture and the breading was airy and didnt have an especially strong taste, perfect for the light and slightly sweet tartar sauce. I would skip the fried seafood platter and go for something more like the crab cakes as there seems to b a certain batter that nola ppl like and maybe these restaurants don't stray far from it.

At this point I was stuffed but I had to try the bread pudding and it was crack... i never had such thick soft sweet syrupy bread pudding that one bite put me in the middle of the land of milk and honey sittin atop the soft boobs of bread w praline brown liquid gold drizzled on top of me.

This place was really awesome, but no more cajun for me for awhile I think I'll have to go veggies w minimal taste to get my tastebuds and cardiac health back",2018-04-10 05:02:44

My first experience was a late night craving for Bread Pudding on our second Nola visit. We had been drinking and touristing all day. It was a chilly Early March evening and I had a wicked craving for Bread pudding, which a quick Yelp search told me this was a good bet- and Oh Lord it was!

The next time was for PoBoys. 

Tonight we visited again and our server Errol, AKA James Earl Jones of New Orleans (based on this man's deep, delicious voice), made our visit as wonderful. 

I had a shrimp PoBoy, Ian had shrimp plate and his sister had the seafood sampler. They were all huge portions and quite good. I wish the dressing on my PoBoy was a little better put over the full bun. It was difficult to eat, but aren't all good PoBoys?

The best: the crab cake app. OH MY GOD. That was so amazing with a crawfish mushroom sauce one could literally bottle up and take to heaven.

The restaurant is quite dark.  Seating is very rough on metal straight chairs and metal base tables with uncovered table tops.  Very similar to a fast food restaurant.  We were seated quickly and our waiter was fast and attentive.

Food was very good.  I had the seafood gumbo which was only average.  One in our party had raw oysters and indicated they were very good and fresh.  Two of us had the blackened redfish with etou'fee.  It was really excellent.  The fish was cooked perfectly, the seasoning was spicy, but not too hot, and the etou'fee was very good.  The fish came with jambalaya and collards.

Strolling through the French Quarter one certainly has many options but by sheer chance this place caught my eye. 

I ordered the BBQ Shrimp for an app. For my entree I had the Crab Cakes and an Abita Amber to wash it down. HANDS DOWN THE BEST MEAL I HAVE EVER EATEN IN MY LIFE!!!

I have since returned to NOLA with my girlfriend in October 2010 and this is the first place we went. I again ordered the same as I had been craving it for the 7 months between my visits.

It was, after all, jazz fest weekend (2012) and things were busy. So we asked for a restaurant recommendation and Oceana was the ""I guess if you don't want to walk too far this will be fine"" option given to us. 

Boy, were we ever blown away by the house oysters! I never liked oysters, but these were like a party in my mouth and I think the darling bf and I fell in love over (and with!) those oysters. 

It's now almost a year later and all I wanted to do was surprise him with a trip back to NoLA for our one year anniversary. Right after booking the trip he said, ""We can have those oysters every day!"" I knew (for the millionth time) I was with my soul mate when he said that. We probably love those oysters more than we love each other - they're that good.

It was then that I realized I'd never reviewed this place and that's a shame. We dream about that sauce the oysters are in and we talk about them every time we talk about that trip. Everyone said ""Go to Drago's! Get the oysters!"" And so we did, but after these we were totally disappointed with Drago's. Oceana had our hearts and still does. 

I'm thrilled that we get to go back to celebrate our first year together. And certainly that darling boyfriend should put a diamond instead of a pearl in my oyster, right!?",2013-02-04 17:10:15

I was dissapointed in the amount of rice with the beans and asked for more. There was a charge of course.

The concierge at the Omni said Oceana has a fantastic breakfast so watch for an update.

Breakfast update:

Oceana lost a star based on breakfast. I had the St. James crepe. The crepe was doughy and flavorless.  It had a generous stuffing of shrimp and crab as well as grilled onions and peppers and cheddar cheese topping. The flavor was bland.

Steve did enjoy the seafood omelette.

(Spoiler alert:  This is not a 4 or 5 star restaurant)  I had a server at the Capital Grille in Houston recommend it to me for the crab cakes & BBQ shrimp so I went.  First thing you'll notice is the line down the street to get in.  However, if you'll eat at the bar you can bypass the line.  I did.

Abita Amber 16 oz. draft for $4.50 served by Meghan.  Really nice server, thumbs up, personable & attentive.  Decent price for a beer on Bourbon Street.

The crab cake appetizer is two crab cakes topped with a spicy sauce & some crawfish tails.  It literally took 2 minutes from order until it showed up in front of me.  I thought it was tasty, the spicy sauce gave it good flavor.  It was warm, not hot, and I'd say the sauce helped cover the fact there was a fair amount of filler besides crab in the cake.  However, I'll give this dish between 2 & 3 stars.  If it had been served hot & fresh it'd be 3 stars.

The BBQ shrimp appetizer is 5 large shrimp.  That's a fair enough deal for the price.  However, I put my finger in the sauce and if it was 90 degrees I'd be surprised.  I've had warmer baths than the BBQ sauce.  The bread served with the shrimp is totally bland.  They took a baguette & sliced it a few hours ago.  Not heated, buttered, seasoned or anything.  Dried out, white baguette.  I peeled the shrimp & this is where it gets bad.  The shrimp were so overcooked you had to fight to get the shell off.  Literally every segment of the tail shell had to be peeled off the shrimp.  You should be able to pinch the tail of a properly cooked shrimp & have it pop out of the last two segments.  You couldn't pinch the tail and get the meat to pop out of the fan at the very back.  In short, horribly overcooked & very difficult to peel.  The flavor?  One overpowering note - Worcestershire.  BBQ shrimp sauce should be a blend of butter, Worcestershire & spices.  This dish was 1 star, had it been served hot I'd have given it 2 stars & if the shrimp had been perfectly cooked it might have gotten to 3 stars.

The ambience of the restaurant is totally touristy.  People lined down the street to get in, setting at the bar looking around I didn't see a lot to convince me that it was particularly clean.  It looked like it needed a good scrubbing.  I liked my server; she was good.  I saw several managers doing actual work & they checked in on me twice to make sure I was doing ok.  The service was good from server to management.

My conclusion?  I don't see why anyone would wait in line to eat here.  The BBQ shrimp at Deanie's are much better.  Then again, this is a restaurant at the corner of Bourbon Street & Conti Street in the heart of the tourist trap Bourbon Street.  I should have known better.  It's not awful but it's a long way from special.  If you've come to New Orleans looking for spectacular food this isn't the place.  If you've come to New Orleans looking to party your butt off and you need something to put in your stomach to soak up the alcohol then this place will do.",2015-08-27 02:38:44

Out of the five things we ordered: crab cakes, catfish po boy, chicken alfredo with blackened chicken, pecan pie and kahlua chocolate pie, I only *really* liked the blackened chicken alfredo. It's sauce was seasoned and great. The pecan pie was pretty good. Nothing else I liked much.

The crab cake was not good to me at all. It was soggy and had minimal flavor internally. 

The fries had a batter on them and I don't enjoy that personally, but my husband loves that kind of French fry. 

Catfish tastes fresh and clean, so that's good!

Our server was very polite and prompt and our food came put pretty quickly which we appreciated.

However it's one of the few places nearby that are pretty good for kids. We tried three different restaurants before we had to come here because the others were 21+ or closed in the afternoon til 6. 

I probably wouldn't recommend this place to anyone unless they were really into alfredo, because that was good enough to warrant visiting. I bet their blackened food is generally better overall.",2018-06-02 03:18:16

It was our last night in New Orleans, and I was on a mission to consume as many oysters as possible. Oceana was about the only place we could still get oysters on the half shell after 10pm so we ordered a couple of drinks, some raw oysters, and the fried alligator for good measure. Our plan was to try the food, see how it was, and order more as needed. Unfortunately, after our food and drinks arrived, it became pretty clear we wouldn't be ordering any more.

Our big mistake was coming here after closing down Felix's. The oysters at Oceana just couldn't compare - they were perfectly serviceable oysters, but they were bone dry. It seemed like they'd probably been shucked much earlier and had dried out waiting to be plated. I could have lived with dry oysters, but the alligator bites were really awful - just pure gristle. I know alligator can be chewy, but this was something really... special. We left them mostly untouched, paid our bill, and hightailed it out of there.

The atmosphere at Oceana seems pretty friendly and it's entirely possible we'd have had a better experience during typical meal hours.

They were able to immediately accommodate our party of 6 and didnt seem to have any problems when in the middle of the meal we had a 7th join us, which was much appreciated. 

The menu reads kind of like a cheap commercial restaurant that is trying to appeal to tourists who probably want the sense that they are getting cajun food, but aren't concerned with authenticity. Unfortunately, seemingly nearly every item on the menu is fried. I had a ""blackened alligator"" po boy, which was frankly very pedestrian. Despite being advertised as ""blackened"" it was pretty flavorless. Additionally, I needed a little caffeine to help me find the energy for a 2 hour walking tour, so I ordered a cup of coffee with dinner, which was a big mistake. I got a cold, cup of black coffee, which seemed like it had been brewed much earlier in the morning.

Overall, it was a pleasant experience and the food was OK but for the price they should give you more of it or cook it better! They probably won't, though.

We stumbled across it when we were exploring the French Quarter, and stopped in to eat after looking at the menu. When I saw they had good reviews, AND a Yelp check-in special, we were sold. For a group of 9 people in the afternoon, we had a decent wait, but the staff was great at keeping us updated and checking in on us. 

First of all, the service here is unrivaled in the type of restaurant they are. The only place I had comparable service was at Commander's Palace, and these restaurants are not in the same style. Service like that is a requirement at a swanky establishment like Commander's Palace, but comparable service like that at Oceana was a phenomenal surprise. We even remarked that we had never been greeted so warmly and so welcoming from EVERY single staff member we encountered. 

We waited a decent amount for food, but nothing unreasonable given how busy it was and how large our party was. On to the food review!

Alligator Bites: These were great. We got a 1/2 order of the blackened and the fried and it was the best decision ever. The fried bites were crunchy with a great breading, while the blackened had a smoky, semi-spicy flavor. The dipping sauce that comes with them is wonderful as well. I would definitely order these again!

Po Boys: I was the only person at our table who did not order a Po Boy. However, everyone raved about how great they were. Luckily, my wonderful husband let me have a bite of his catfish po boy, and oh man. It was GREAT. This was my favorite Po Boy that we had all trip, and was actually my husband's favorite item the whole trip. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

Seafood Gumbo: This was a little disappointing. The crab and seafood in the gumbo was good, but the rest of it felt a little lacking in flavor. I had never had real gumbo before, however, so I am not a good judge on gumbo.

Crab Cakes: These were very good. They were the perfect size and I loved that they had little shrimps in them as well as crab. The dip was slightly spicy and a perfect pairing.

Overall, we really enjoyed the food at Oceana and were blown away by the service. We would definitely come back here if we ever travel south again.",2017-03-24 19:45:46

Being from Maryland we know a thing or two about crab cakes and no, Oceana Grill is not claiming to compare to Maryland crab cakes but are serving them as you would expect them to being here in New Orleans. They were fried blue crab, crab cakes with crawfish and mushroom sauce. After the appetizers I ordered the red beans and rice with sausage and my wife had the shrimp creole. Both dishes were amazing, with the spicy flavor you would expect

Our waiter was Alex and after a little conversation that this was our first trip to New Orleans he guided us and explained everything on the menu. He was excellent and energetic. 

The experience at Oceana Grill was outstanding and will be back for dinner before heading home. 

Thank you Oceana Grill. .",2018-03-29 20:08:54

My husband ordered the catfish po' boy.  Lets just say that we received our food well after everyone who came after us.  Even the party of 6 received their food before we did.  I had gumbo soup. It was pretty good.  Not too salty and not tomato based.  It tastes like true gumbo.  Fries were frozen from a bag.  The blacken catfish was tasty even without extra sauce added.

We saw the reviews on Urban Spoon and Yelp prior to going and decided to give it a chance. The husband ordered a dozen oysters on the half shell and the Oceana Famous Oysters. He wanted half just chargrilled without the cream sauce and the other half regular. He said he overheard the waiter arguing about his order with another member of the staff when he was leaving the restroom...

The oysters on the half shell were just ok; they definitely weren't as good as the ones we got from Felix Saturday evening. The oysters from Oceana were dry and somewhat tough. The Cajun Bloody Mary was pretty awesome. I ordered the Redfish Oceana as my entree, but requested to have it blackened with the etoufee sauce and the original sides (roasted potatoes and veggies; the blackened option comes with jambalaya, but it has pork in it, which we don't eat). We were quoted an additional $5 for the crawfish, which I was fine with. The husband ordered the crawfish etoufee entree. Had I known that I was only going to get one crawfish with my etoufee on my redfish, I would have just used some of the husband's. The crawfish etoufee itself was good; however, there was not enough etoufee on my fish to justify the $5 charge. Also, the veggies are bland and lacking in flavor. 

The bill came and there was an additional $7 to our bill; the waiter couldn't determine where it came from or why it was there (we understood the $5, but didn't know where the additional $2 went), so the manager ended up taking it off altogether.  Also, we realized that their menu is precisely the same as a restaurant on Bourbon (I can't remember the name, but it appears that they're owned by the same parent company, the menu prices are just slightly different).",2012-11-16 16:33:25

Oysters were very over seasoned, and hard to taste the actual seafood. Bread that came with it was soggy as hell.

The po-boy was actually very nice: bread was crisp and the fish was cooked well, but a little over seasoned. Seamed like fresh tomatoes and lettuce. Served with fried.

Shrimp was forgettable and ordinary. Tasted like mid-western fish, which was disappointing, since Oceana is so close to fresh fish.

Our waitress did not know different beer at all, but she was cute and charming. The entire staff was very friendly and welcoming.
I was very surprised that this place was on Kitchen Nightmares 4 years ago, as they have improved; yet, they have even more room for improvement.

There were several large groups and open tables on the other side but they sat us there. At that point we were starving and didn't care. Kind of glad we sat there because our server was great. Ronaldo? Forgot his name. We were baffled when he was explaining the specials - can't recall exactly what the items were but it was basically: an entree with another entree and a side of this and topped with an appetizer... On one dish. Something you'd put together at home in full fatty mode. Seemed super promising at that point! So we ordered the fried seafood platter, crab cakes, and jambalaya / stew combo plate. The food came out very fast. The red beans and rice were delicious - the smokiness and flavor were on point. Texture was perfect, not watery and full bodied. Best red beans and rice we had. The jambalaya and etoufee were decent but nothing spectacular. The crab cakes were cooked right but had a lot of filler and was slightly fishy. The fried seafood platter was poorly executed. Very uneven cooking, the shrimps were cold and soggy, the oysters were hot and good, the fish was half soggy and half crispy, and the hush puppies were decent and warm. The star of this dish were the French fries - crispy, hot, and so good.

This incident was extremely outraging. It was just before 8 PM (on a Wednesday) when my friend and I called to place an order for delivery. While our hotel was less than a ten minute walk away, we were packing for our return home and did not wish to leave our hotel room. We called, placed our order, and were told it would take about 30-45 minutes. 

After about an hour, our order still had not arrived. It was then that we decided to call back and check the status of our delivery. My friend called back and was told that the order was on its way, and it would be there any minute. Being that it was the day after Mardi Gras, I was understanding that they were probably busy and service was a little slower than usual (I assumed). 

Another half an hour passed by and I decided to call back myself. Again, I was told that they were very busy but it was on it's way and should arrive soon. 

Finally, after yet another thirty minutes, my friend got a call from the restaurant. They informed her that the manager said that they do not deliver ""that far away"" and that he did not realize we were on the other side of Canal Street. It was apparent then that our order was never prepared, it was never sent out for delivery, and no one even bothered to check it's status during the two phone calls we made.

The moral of this story is, if you are placing an order for delivery, be sure to ask in advance to ensure that they will deliver to your hotel or address in which you are staying. Unfortunately for us, we had to wait two hours for them to realize their mistake. It was absolutely unprofessional behavior from an establishment in such a touristy area. I was appalled at how little they seemed to care that they left us waiting until 10 PM at night, after we called back TWICE. They clearly did not check to make sure our order was out, since we took the initiative to make sure it had been placed. Instead properly answering our questions during the calls, they decided to be lazy and just assume that the order was placed and was being delivered. I obviously cannot comment on the quality of the food or the in-house service, but I can say this: I will never set foot in this establishment. I cannot believe the lack of customer service that their employees, including their manager, exhibited during the whole situation. I am absolutely shocked that they made no offering for their mistake nor did they really seem to care that they had kept us waiting for two hours.",2015-02-26 14:10:39

Try the Blackened Smoked Duck ($19.00 for a huge 1/2 duck portion), it comes with a generous portion of jambalaya and veggies too.  

The french bread was just OK, but you will get so much on your plate --- you won't bother to eat the bread anyway!

We came back a SECOND TIME to try the seafood options, my wife had the Seafood Platter ($17) and she got a heaping plate of oysters, shrimp and catfish.  She said the shrimp was the best she's ever tried, and she has been all over the world! There was also a heap of ""hush puppies"" and french fries on this platter.   

I had the Blackened Redfish ($14) and was not disappointed --- a huge piece of fish accompanied by the aforementioned platter of jambalaya and vegetables.

My suggestion?  Eat a late lunch here (between 2:30 and 3:30 pm) and then you can skip dinner, because you will be so full!

Highly recommended.",2011-05-20 14:39:59

I ordered the cajun jambalaya pasta, if anyone likes Cajun and can't do spicy this is the perfect dish because it has a mild spicy flavor.

Checked out reviews and all very insistent that the food is first rate; all of it.  The crab cake appetizers were raved about in reviews so we tried them; OMG...  I've never eaten a crab cake with their crawfish sauce with that much crab and perfect seasoning in my life.  Two large crab cakes, perfectly crispy on the outside and just plain perfect inside and out.  My husband had the Blackened Redfish Lafourche; for some reason, not on the menu (just ask for it) crawfish mushroom sauce with fried crawfish on top!  My husband saw the dish on The Food Network and knew he had to have it, it was perfectly blackened, not burnt and amazing seasoning there as well.  I had the perfectly sautéed Oceana Redfish with that amazing crawfish mushroom cream sauce and plenty of fresh crawfish tails on top.  If you are afraid of crawfish, just push them to the side and eat everything else, nothing to be afraid of unless you don't at least eat everything else on your plate.  My husband and I are from/live in New Orleans and we've had dishes like the ones described above and we both are positive we've never had anything THAT good in our lives!  
Our server was Cole and he was one of the best waiters we had ever encountered; so much so that I asked to meet his boss to tell how awesome Cole is.  His manager, Tammy, is incredible as well!

I ordered the Maw Maw's Cajun breakfast and I could not have been more satisfied. It is bits of bacon and shrimp scrambled with eggs and served over rice. It comes with a biscuit.

Part of the reason I ordered it was because it had bacon. I must admit, I didn't taste any bacon, but it may have just been overpowered by all the other incredible, deep flavors. The shrimp were perfectly cooked and the rice was absolutely fantastic. My biscuit was not overly impressive, but I hadn't ordered the dish for the biscuit.

The portion was very generous and my biggest disappointment with my breakfast was that I wasn't able to finish it.

I also enjoyed a couple of bloody marys and they were fantastic as well.

I just want to thank my mom for giving birth to me just because it blessed me with the chance to eat at this place. 
Seriously, so good. My husband and I went to another restaurant first and the service was terrible (luckily) so we stumbled (literally) upon this place. The guy handed menus to us at the door was nice so I said ""thank you"" and he said ""after you eat here you'll be thanking me again"" and he was so right.
I got the chicken Alfredo and had them make it blackened chicken and I got a double hurricane to drink ($15 for the double) my husband got the catfish platter and a double blood marry.
The chicken alfredo was honestly the best food I've ever had in my life. You know when food is so good that you have audible sighs of pleasure with every bite? Yeah, that was both of us. Our table was almost rated R.

My complaint about this place is the prices.  We ordered 3 po boys and 1 red beans and rice with sausage and it came it a little over $60.  

With that price why would I ever give this place 4 stars?  Frankly the food was good.  My parents both chose blackened meats which they loved the taste of.  This was especially important because my dad has high cholesterol and was trying not to eat fried food which we know is a tall order in NOLA.  My red beans was very flavorful, and there was enough for me to eat for two days.

I do not know if they are always this fast, but on this night, they were really fast.  It seemed like less than 15 minutes from the time we placed our order until they were knocking at the door.  The food, itself, was pretty good, too. 

We loved the vegetarian section of the menu, and ordered the Spinach Ravioli at $15.50, and the Cajun Vegetarian Stew a $13.00.  We also ordered one, Caesar Salad for $5.50  Everything was pretty good, but not great.  

You can get the Ravioli in your choice of Alfredo Sauce, Marinara, or Oceana Cream Sauce.  We opted for the marinara, but it was unlike any marinara we ever had.  It wasn't really red.  It was more like a red/brown gravy.  Nonetheless, the flavor was good, as was the texture and flavor of the raviolis.  

The gravy for the Cajun Vegetarian Stew looked very similar to the marinara for the ravioli, but the taste was very different.  I actually like the stew better than the ravioli.  It was pretty much the way it was described in the menu, as was the Caesar Salad.  

Of the three, the salad was the best value.  The portion sizes on the entrees seemed a bit small for the price.  The salad was about right, and about what we've come to expect.  

If I had to do it all over again, I would order from this place.  There is a great variety on the menu, and the speed of delivery was amazing.  If you just don't feel like going out, this is a good option, and it really was worth it to us to pay a little extra.

The vibe inside is really great and relaxed. Our waiter was very accommodating and understanding of my ""dietary restrictions"". He recommended the cajun veggie stew for me without butter or cheese. Since my mum's a huge seafood lover, she got two types of oysters as an appetizer and the catfish special with blackened catfish, fried crawfish and jambalaya rice.

I lived in NOLA during gradschool more years ago than I care to remember or admit and I've heard of Oceana Grill but this was my 1st visit. We went there looking for blackened alligator  (my g.f. is from N.Y. and wanted to have some while we were in town and Oceana Grill was listed as one of the 10 best places for alligator in NOLA when I did a Google search.) We ordered the blackened alligator appetizer with extra remoulade and that certainly lived up to our expectations. Blackened alligator has always been my favorite preparation and theirs was tender and extremely flavorful. Just what we were looking for.  I also love oysters in just about any preparation and decided to order their Oceana Grill oysters because I didn't get to make it to the Oyster Festival this past weekend. Now, I have had grilled oysters from Drago's and Acme and a number of other places and until today Acme was always my favorite. But the cream sauce they put on theirs at Oceana blew us away!!! These are hands-down the best grilled oysters I have ever had. The oysters themselves had a delightful smokiness aside from the rich cream sauce that they slathered on top. The addition of the cream to the sauce thickens it and helps it to stay on the oyster instead of running all over the plate and they serve the oysters with plastic sporks so that you can make sure to get all the goodness out of the shell without having to embarrass yourself and your date by licking the shell right there at the table :-) but rest assured that had they not served the oysters with those much-needed sporks I would have gladly licked every square inch of those shells to get every drop of that delicious sauce. ;-) The wait staff was great, the runner that brought our food had a delightful personality and the management was also warm, friendly and attentive to everyone's needs. This is the best of what I remember about living in New Orleans and the people that make up this wonderful City. Give Oceana Grill a try if you haven't already or hurry back if you have.

This restaurant came recommended by the front desk at the hotel I was staying at. While I don't exactly regret going here, it wasn't exactly what I wanted. The food is on the more expensive side, but it's off of Bourbon Street so I guess they can charge a premium. We had to wait outside the restaurant for a little before being able to go in. At first we thought the restaurant was mostly empty, but it turns out this restaurant is multi-levels and takes up most of the block. 

When we were finally seated we decided to order an appetizer. We went for the crab cakes. They were good but there were only 2 crab cakes for $14. They were large but I was expecting more of them for the price. But we enjoyed them, so I can't complain too much. 

For my entree, I ended up with the Redfish Oceana - their signature dish. Sauteed redfish topped with crawfish mushroom cream sauce served with roasted garlic potatoes and sauteed vegetables.

Happened to stroll by Oceana,, checked out their posted menu, and took a chance.  Very glad we did.

Pluses (this is for breakfast, remember) --

Serves breakfast menu until 1 p.m,
Excellent chicory coffee in big mugs
Friendly and efficient staff
Lots of customers, but not noisy
Wonderful seafood omelets brimming with huge, juicy shrimp, very tasty, 
   even better with an added sprinkle of Louisiana hot sauce
Great biscuit and good fried potatoes with the omelets

Minuses -- 

None major.  We had to ask for butter for the biscuits and when it came, it was in 
     those teeny plastic containers  that are impossible to open.  Places that do this
      always make me wonder:  is providing a decent size serving of condiments 
      so hard?  Ditto with the jelly packet, BTW.  A tub of butter and a jar of good jam,

I am a strong believer in taking restaurant recommendations from Taxi drivers because it has never failed me.  My driver suggested Oceana for breakfast, so according to ""Maggie's Dogma"" we went to Oceana for breakfast!  

I ordered their Pain Perdu (northerner speak: French toast) and it was absolutely amazing. Not only was it made with French bread but they obviously cooked it on the same skillet as everything else.  This made it especially yummy because I got little traces of onion, sausage, and bacon on the French toast that gave the sweet breakfast another dimension.  In addition, the batter they used was flavorful enough that I didn't use any syrup on it.

My friend had the biscuits and gravy, which looked good to me regardless of the fact that I don't like gravy.  It had big chunks of sausage in the gravy instead of just being made from the fat of the sausage.

We came and they were able to accomodate a group of 20 very quickly!  I have to say I was impressed.  We were seated and greeted promptly by our server.  I was a little iffy coming here, since I've been here one time before and didn't have that great of an experience, but that night, everything was great!

I ordered the jamabalaya pasta with alligator sausage and shrimp, and my boyfriend had the alligator po-boy.  My pasta was great!  The sausage was tender and the sauce was flavorful.  There were several other people who ordered it at my table and they too enjoyed the dish.  No, it's not the best food in New Orleans, but for a place that opens so late, it's pretty darn delightful!  Hahaha.  I didn't get a bite of my boyfriend's po-boy, but he said he really good, so I'll take his word for it.  For dessert we got the bread pudding and the bananas foster ice cream cake.  Both were decadent and yummy, but definitely NOT the outstanding.

The service was excellent for accomodating a group of 20 and fairly quick too!  Maybe they just wanted to go home?  Possibly.  And the location is convenient, since it's right off of Bourbon.

It is a New Orleans-themed Joe's Crab Shack or Olive Garden.  There's nothing bad, just nothing worth four stars.

The Oysters Oceana is good, but what's not good with cream and garlic and cheese on top?  The bread that is served with it was stale and there were only two small pieces -- not enough to enjoy that buttery, creamy, cheesy garlic sauce.

The oyster Po' Boy was only OK.  Still in 4 years, they haven't corrected their roll problems.  The hot oysters are dumped on a roll of undetermined age that has not been warmed or toasted.  There is virtually no dressing (a little onion, tomato and shredded lettuce or a spicy mayo maybe !!??) and it's a boring little sandwich.

The Redfish Oceana, is likewise, just fine.  I didn't appreciate that it wasn't hot when it was served.  Just barely better than warm. The fish was cooked OK, a little more done than a truly skilled chef would allow.  The greens were fine and the mashed potatoes were...again, hard to screw up mashed potatoes.

If I could give this place 1/2 a star, that would be the score. I am born and raised in New Orleans and although this PLACE has been around a long time, the OWNERS are not the original family who has owned it since it started but they never say that they continue to pretend they are the real deal.  I do not know where the current owners were born but I do know it was not in New Orleans or even in the United States.  

Creole and Cajun food are DIFFERENT cultures with different food and different languages and different music to those who don't know that. It would be like throwing Mexican and Spanish all together in one pot.  OR throwing Chinese and Japanese together in one pot. 

I think the two brothers who are NOW the owners are riding on the history of the ADDRESS of the building in the French Quarter and the tourists do not know the  the history of the actual food being served because there are so few Creoles or Cajuns who have a say in the matter.  

People don't know that they are eating something Gordon Ramsey (who has no historical reference for OUR Creole or Cajun food, because he's a Brit with a TV show) approximates as culturally ""about right"" food. BLAH!

The food: we had the eggplant strips and I enjoyed them. The sauce they came with were good too. They reminded me of french fries. The crabcake was good too but not great.  The oysters were less than ok. The oysters had this parmesan like sprinkle and that was not a good addition to it.

I could also see long waits outside the restaurant from my hotel balcony. The 2 stars are for the rude staff at the front door and the confusion regarding online reservations. On Friday I made online reservations for Saturday at 4pm.  At 1pm on  Saturday I could see from my hotel  balcony that no one was waiting outside(which was unusual )  I called Oceana &  they said come down because  there was no wait. It took us no more than  3 minutes to get there. Once we arrived the lady out front wanted us to wait outside because  more people had just arrive. Eventually  she allowed my husband and I  to sit at the bar. There was only one customer sitting at the empty  bar, plenty of room for more customers.  I than spoke to another lady at the front desk,   I proceeded to tell her about our  4 pm reservations. She  blurted out I didn't make reservations  because it was Saturday and they don't take reservations on Saturday.  We were  than seated on the first level.  Our server Jimal was wonderful .  The food was very good. We had etoufee, fried oysters, crab cakes,  blackened red fish, mustard greens and  chocolate cheesecake. 
The crab cakes were good but disappointly  cold.  The Gumbo Shop crab cakes are similar to Oceana  but the Gumbo Shops are slightly better. If you want crabcakes and less of a wait time go to The Gumbo Shop. The  Atmosphere at Oceana is not impressive. It is loud and there's a constant cold draft from a open window at the bar..
In Summary,  the food is good, quality is  similar to the  quality of the Gumbo Shop on St. Peters St. The restaurant  atmosphere lacks the New Orleans flair.  Staff /hotesses need training on customer service . Employees  need to be aware of their company 's online reservation system on their website. The long waits outside is due to mismanagement of customers.",2018-03-31 19:49:31

We waited ten minutes for refills on our water and when our check came, we waited 15 more minutes for the waitress to return our cards. Not only was the food subpar for New Orleans, but the waitress mischarged my card for 3x the amount of my meal. I was on the phone not only with their accounting department but also with my bank for 2 hours because the waitress overdrafted my account for several days. My bank will not reverse the fee as it was not a banking error, and the restaurant will not take responsibility for their inept waitress. I am highly disappointed with the service I received and will not be returning any time in the future.

Food was too expensive for the quality I received. Southern hospitality my ass.",2015-07-23 14:38:36

While the place is pretty small, their food is really, really good. My mom and I split a fried seafood platter thing and it was a good amount for the both of us. I can't recall what was in it exactly, but I'm sure it had the usual: shrimp, fish, fries, etc.

My dad on the other hand got some sort of sampler platter that had etouffee, jambalaya and something else. It might have been boudin but I can't say for sure. But you know, just a little taste of everything. He let me try a little bit of everything from his plate and WOW. Everything was great, but there was one that was definitely a favorite for me.

We thought ""Oh hey, long line this must be good!"" When we got to the front of the line (we were a party of 9), the guy in charge of bringing customers in moved my group to the other side of the door outside. So first, he told us the wait would be 20 minutes (hence why we stayed in line), then he told us it'd be 10 minutes when he moved us out of the line. Then we ended up waiting an hour outside. About 20 people went into the restaurant that were in line after us but they were smaller parties so we didn't think anything of it. While we were waiting for an hour, a party of 11 and another party of 8 who came in line after us were seated before my party. We were extremely upset. One of the girls in our party had to go into the restaurant and talk to the manager. Thank goodness he was rational and seated us right away upstairs. When we got upstairs, I didn't understand why there were so many tables open but they couldn't seat us. Maybe they were understaffed? 

Our server was very nice and entertaining so that was nice. The manager also came to check up on us a few times to make sure we were doing fine. Food came out fast too.

I ordered the oysters and shrimp and crab gumbo. The oysters were good so I was very happy. The gumbo was also delicious. My date tried the alligator sausage and he still dreamt about it days later.

I sat at the bar and it was pretty full all over, and I took the menu and went for Oceana's famous Char-grilled Oysters.

Maybe I had unrealistic expectations.  We had a reservation and arrived a little early.  No problem.  Seated right away.  However, when we left, the line-up outside was about 20-30 deep and on the street.

My disappointment was NOT WITH THE STAFF, who were sharp, on top of things and very eager to assist and correct ""oops"" from kitchen.

Their Grilled Oysters were ok., not bad, but we had better at other places during the week.  Theirs was in a cream sauce that was nothing special, which had a slight bite to it.  Again, not a complaint.

Service was very good.  Attentive, supportive, but not effusive.  

Ordered the Redfish Ponchartrain with crawfish and a creamy shrimp sauce --special of the night.  The sauce was lovely, but the Redfish was very dry and overcooked.  Usually never send a dish back. But I spoke with the waitress, who spoke with a mgr who immediately removed it and returned a later with a replacement.  Nicely done.  Unfortunately, while the fish was not as dry, it was still, neither moist, nor flaky, nor what I had hoped for.  Their mustard greens on the side were outstanding -- moist, flavorful and delicious.

Spouse ordered the Blackened Ahi Tuna - med/rare.  It was also a bit overcooked.  I often make this at home and it might have been our fault for not ordering it rare instead of Med/Rare.  It was red inside, but also a bit dry.  The spices were soft, not strong, which is not necessarily a bad thing, just not up to our standards.

The bill with 2 wines and 2 beers approached $100.  We tipped well because staff support and service was what it was supposed to be.  However, the food was well below what we expected, and certainly below every other meal we ate either in the French Quarter, the CBD, Uptown, the Garden District, or in and around the suburbs.",2018-04-01 19:53:42

I'm giving Oceana 3 starts though it's more like a 3.5. I was in New Orleans with a party of 15 first timers and all of them agreed that in New Orleans you either have good food or great food. Oceana is good. If Oceana was in Sacramento I'd be estatic to have a restaurant that serves up quality New Orleans cuisine.  However, since Oceana is located in New Orleans I would say it's good, but not great. 

The best thing about Oceana is the location and the fact that they can accommodate a large party without setting a minimum dollar amount that one has to spend. The service was overall was good. The servers were friendly, filled our waters without having to be asked, and checked on us frequently.  I had the blackened duck which was a tasty dish. The flavor was nice, the meat was moist, and the sauce on top was delicious. However, it just wasn't on par with other meals I ate in New Orleans. My suggestion is if you have a large party, give Oceana a shot. They are very accommodating, the food isn't bad, and the servers are faultless.

If you have a smaller party go elsewhere.",2015-04-22 20:13:18

My first dining experience at Oceana was EPIC. Nearly 2 years ago, they were throwing a hospitality spread for industry folks in the Quarter.  Well, to my growling tummy's disappointment, all the food was gone when I finally got my lunch break :(  Never fear!  The manager scooted me up to the bar and asked me what I like, to which I responded as I always do... ""Everything. Anything.""  Moments later, I was (complimentary) showered with two entrees AND an appetizer platter... All that glorious food just sitting there, egging a fatty on.  Generous tip, check.

But my true weakness, is them damn crabcakes.  Oh, tender crab meat smothered in life-affirming crawfish-mushroom sauce... it is my crack.  When my parents visited over the holidays, I brought them here insisting that these are a New Orleans must-try... and all that boasting did not go unsettled.

If I could eat this every day I would-so big I could not finish it!

Lovely interior courtyard seating with umbrellas.  Attentive staff.

Amazing art by local artist Simon.  My favorite was the sculpture in the courtyard with an homage to New Orleans music and Bayou wildlife-made out of a keg piled high sculpturally with a variety of vintage musical instruments and spires emanating out of the top with symbols of crawfish and other Bayou area wildlife.

FYI-Funny part was the overhead music playing on the patio-it sounded like someone singing in Reggae fashion about cooking up raccoon among other things in a big pot with cajun seasonings and inviting people over to eat. Absolutely hilarious to an outsider and surprising to hear over breakfast (4/28/17). I have to say it was an interesting historical and culinary education (the song) in itself.

About the Writer/Singer of the Song-
FYI2-The song is by local Big Chief Monk Boudreaux and it is called ""Footsteps!""

One big detractor - mice on the patio.  Maybe it would be better not to seat people close enough to the giant mousetraps that they can watch the wildlife during dinner.

Ordered the gator bites as an appetizer. Half blackened and half fried. Both were great

The kids and I Split the crawfish fries, gator sausage Poboy, and crab cakes as our meal. The gator tail was far superior to the sausage. Crab cakes were good. The fries were the best. 

Biggest annoyance and kinda damper on the evening was when food came. For the poboy we asked for the coleslaw and pickles on the side since the kids didn't eat it. Our waitress was actually the one who asked if we wanted to do that. When the food came it was on there. She noticed it and asked if that was ok. I said no since the kids don't eat it and we had asked for it on the side. She took it to the back and all they did was scrape it off. Bread is cheap. No reason to give us now soggy bread for your mistake. We ended up eating it with no bread. 

Jeremy ordered red fish pontchartrain. He said it was amazing. 

We were too full for dessert but they looked great. 

The waitress was attentive. However, my son tried to interact with her and she ignored him. 

The portions were all a nice size. I really went back and forth with the four or five stars but ended up going with four because of the clear just not caring about our happiness.",2018-06-16 22:24:45

For my parents and me, I ordered the Taste of New Orleans (creole jambalaya, crawfish etouffe, and red beans with rice and smoked sausage), the Grilled Cajun Alligator Sausage Po Boy, a cup of seafood gumbo, and a cup of turtle soup.

All of the dishes were pretty good. I like the Taste of New Orleans for its variety. The alligator sausage was very good. I expected the alligator to be a bit tougher, but then again, it's in sausage form. If I had tough sausage, that would be a bit of a problem. It was my first time trying turtle soup, so I had nothing to compare it to; are they usually a little on the sour side? Nevertheless, I still ate the entire cup. As for the seafood gumbo, I've had better.

Service wasn't anything special, but everything came out at the right time. Drinks came in huge, plastic glasses, which I guess is good for the hot, sticky environment. Got to stay hydrated!

We looked this place up on Yelp and asked some locals and it was recommended. Also Yelp had a 10% off coupon on it. 

We got here around 6:00. Heard it gets pretty crowded. We started off with 2 appetizers. The crab cake and the BBQ shrimp. My favorite of the 2 were the crab cakes. They were so good!  They even had some crawfish on the top. Great flavoring. The BBQ shrimp were ok, but mainly I wanted to try them because they've been on just about every menu we've looked at. They're good too but not as good as the crab cake. The shrimp also have a little kick to them. 

The fried shrimp were good. More than I could eat though. I got the garlic mashed potatoes with them instead of French fries. The cole slaw was good but had more mayonnaise than I prefer. My husband enjoyed the crawfish étouffée. He had no complaints. 

Mike was our waiter and he was very attentive and helpful. I give him 5 stars.

The hostess was rude to my cousin and told her there was nothing they could do. Didn't send a manager out or anything. Ughh not to mention when we arrived at 1pm there was a line around the corner. So we made do and found seats at the bar. 

This turned out to work for the best. Our bartender took care of our every need(it was 5 of us) and asked us every few minutes if we were good. She was amazing--I can't remember her name is what sucks! Anyway, I ordered the Mumm Prosecca. It was ok in taste but I surely felt it in my system which made me not mind the taste after a while. I also tried the house  tropical hurricane which tasted Amazing!!! The bartender told me what was in it but all I remember is it was rum based! Also please note the drink can be made incorrectly---came back later that day and the guy bartender did not make it as good. 

Now for the food: 

1. Alligator bites-- were sooooo good! You can get them grilled or fried or order it half and half. I never had grilled alligator but the grilled and fried were both good! 

2. House Gumbo-again soooooooo good! OMG some of the best gumbo I ever had. the house gumbo is a must if you come here! 

3. Shrimp POBOY-you can't be in New Orleans and not get a POBOY! Oceana made my POBOY very good, i just wish my bun was a little softer, other than that I enjoyed!

I am not sure if it was because it was essence weekend when I went that it was soo crowded (both times I went) but I highly suggest you make a reservation.  Or If you don't mind and you have a small group I would sit at the bar ---they are more attentive and faster service!

The specialty drinks are GREAT. Ok so they are overpriced. But they are strong and the variety of the options makes it fun to try as many as you can before you fall out of your chair.

The food was pretty good too. It isn't bar food, although you can get the fried this or that to sit in your gut to soak up the alcohol. Nope, they have other nice options too. 
I thought the gumbo was good but nothing to write home about. Wife loved her catfish Po'Boy. I had some fish dinner kind of thing which was great.

The shucked oysters were oysters, we've had more flavorful oysters but that always depends on where they come from. 
The baked oysters were pretty good though.

Now the missing star. The smell upon entry. It's the downstairs bar area. It stinks. It needs a good scrub down from ceiling to floor to get rid of that nasty Bourbon St stank.

After being seated, the staff was there right away, very attentive, quick, thorough, and knew what they were doing. Also very accommodating to special requests. We had to wait for our bar drinks for a while, but no big deal, we were more hungry than anything else. We ordered the fresh oysters on the half shell to start. Those suckers went down smooth and delicious with no gritty bottom of the ocean taste. I was very pleased. We ordered a couple items off the chef's specials. The ""fall of the fork"" 1/2 slab of bbq ribs were amazing, great flavor,  tender meat, but...they did not fall off the bone. That was ok for us, the subtle and NOT overpowering bbq sauce and tenderness of the meat made up for that. The blackened bayou duck was really a very pleasant surprise! I'd say one of the best duck dishes I have ever eaten TO DATE! Every bite I took from every part of that duck was amazing. The meat was tender, the flavor was smoky and perfect. No gamey flavor. I definitely recommend this dish for anyone who loves duck or anyone who wants to try it for the first time. You won't be disappointed! My friend was craving fried food and opted for the Seaford platter full of catfish, shrimp, and oysters. This place did not disappoint. Her craving was satisfied with the piled high goodness of the sea! The Louisiana crabmeat cake topoed with fresh crawfish mushroom cream sauce was, to me, at the same level as the famous maryland crab cakes. And that says alot! Perfectly blended flavors and the right sauce on top. Definitely one dish to order if you love crabmeat! Now, to go back to where I started...that bread pudding got me like...whoah! THE BEST BREAD PUDDING I HAVE HAD IN MY LIFE! The moistness, but not gooey, the raisins, which I've never liked but loved in this, the rum, i hate overpowering bitter rum when used in bread pudding, but not this time. This place does it right.

The menu was beaten up and required some attention to read past the dull corners of the plastic seal. No Oysters. No Rockefeller or otherwise (they were out of the last for the day). Ended up with an overly creamy crawfish pasta, a dish I had before elsewhere with quite the opposite effect.

My beer glass had crud stuck all over it as well as floating on the inside. My wife had crawfish that was fresh and well fried. The portion would have been enough for both of us.

I had them months before coming to New Orleans and I found raw oysters to just be slimy and gross. I decided that since I was in New Orleans I would give grilled oysters a try. I ordered half a dozen, but I was brought a dozen. Thankfully I had friends at the table to help me dive into these babies. I fell in love with them! I will say that it was doused in some kind of creamy garlic and parmesan sauce that while good, could have been scaled back a smidgen. 

I also had the barbecued shrimp, which weren't that great in my opinion. The sauce was cold and the shrimp tasted like they needed to be cooked a little while longer. My friend had one and she said it tasted like they had literal just taken it out of the gulf. (I must like my shrimp to be the previously frozen variety.) I also had the seafood gumbo which was ok. I think the grilled Oysters overshadowed everything else. 

As I sit in Los Angeles I often find myself craving those Oysters. I just want to make a trip back just to have them.

I really liked the atmosphere - funky seafood related decor with a definite NO style. We were sat near the oyster bar, so we got to watch the guy shuck oysters the whole time, including ours. We had them on the half-shell, and we were happy with the order. Most of the oysters we were served were pretty plump, which was surprising since Hurricane Isaac had just been through a few weeks before and hurricanes are never good for the oyster business. 

We also ordered the alligator tail appetizer and the BBQ shrimp appetizer. While honestly neither were the best I've ever had, both were still quite tasty. We ordered the alligator blackened, but I would say it was less blackened and more just not fried. The edges weren't even brown. Flavor was good, they were juicy, and they came with a pretty good dipping sauce. Now the BBQ shrimp app came with some of the biggest shrimp I've ever seen in the dish! More like prawns or tiny lobsters. The sauce was a little different than I was used to. It wasn't very buttery and you couldn't really note much black pepper, and it almost tasted as if there might have been some white wine in the sauce. That said, it was good and, of course, came with some of that signature crusty french bread to mop up the sauce. 

Service was pretty average, though the server we had was really nice. Strange thing though, service was average speed until we wanted to pay, then it slowed down to a crawl! Usually they're more than happy to speed that part up!",2012-10-30 14:41:22

We got the famous oysters and the crab cakes appetizer. They were both delicious. The oysters were coated in parmesan sauce which gave it a creamy taste.

There wasn't a queue to get in, unlike at ACME, which was a big plus - although I'm pretty sure the queue at ACME is for good reason and while we enjoyed some of our meal here, I know why people aren't lining up out the door.

We sat outside in the pleasant and small courtyard (inside was freezing from too much air conditioning), and we really enjoyed chatting to our extremely friendly server.  We ordered a ton of food - gator tail bites (blackened), Louisiana crabmeat cakes with crawfish and mushroom cream sauce, chargrilled oysters, and something else I can't remember now (this is why I need to write reviews sooner after vacation!  I think it might've been the Taste of New Orleans platter, though I sadly can't remember anything about it.

The thing about the food here is that it was mostly good, but a few dishes were flat-out ruined!  The much-touted crab cakes were good, but they would've been better if the sauce had been brought on the side as I'd asked instead of absolutely being drowned in it!  I really didn't want that much thick creamy sauce on my crabcakes, but I was stuck with it.  Same for the chargrilled oysters.  The ones at ACME were heavenly, the ones here were just drowning in garlic cream sauce and cheese.  Honestly, it was a bit gross.  You couldn't even see the oysters for the sauce.  We were so disappointed as we'd been looking forward to them all night.

I know this review would be a lot better if I could remember the things we liked, but they were sort of overshadowed by the saucy oysters.  We did have great service, and there are 10% off cards floating around all over the city, but if you want a great NOLA seafood experience, this shouldn't be your first stop.  We loved the casual atmosphere that's sort of like a sports bar inside, and a relaxing inner courtyard if you walk through the main room, but the food didn't live up to the bar we'd set elsewhere.

The oyster were cut from the shell but didn't leave the chewy part that attaches to the shell attached to the shell. I had to bite it off and put it back on the plate.

I knew I'd love the place because we walked in and saw a ""Do Not Serve This Man"" sign with a photo of Roger Goodell attached to it. Hysterical! Anyway, we ended up eating here twice because we liked it and it was pretty cheap. 
I had the Biscuits & Gravy the first time and they were divine! The sausage gravy was super spicy (the way I like it) and it was a huge portion. The biscuits were fresh and soft and were covered in the thick gravy. It was a great starter. My husband had the Cajun Sausage breakfast with the alligator and andouille sausage. It was the first time we both had alligator and we enjoyed it. 

The second time we came I got the Pain Perdu and it was okay. I think I've had better.. the day before we had breakfast at Stanley and their food was out-of-this-world good. I wanted to try their Eggs Melanzana but it wasn't on the menu the second time!  My husband had the Royal Omelette and he said it was one of his favorite meals in NOLA.  They did keep telling us to try their Crab Cakes but being from Maryland.. we weren't about to see one of our favorite meals butchered, so we stuck with the stuff we didn't have at home.

Pros: Exceptional staff. Everyone we encountered, from the friendly host to the manager who helped us re-schedule our reservation (and graciously allowed us to show a phone-screen coupon for our meal when we couldn't find a printer) was great. Our server, Michon, was also wonderful and friendly and gave great service. The bartenders we encountered earlier in the day were slightly less friendly, but I'll give them a pass because I can't even imagine being a bartender between the French Quarter and Bourbon Street. The place is also decorated well and the drink menu is full of expensive-yet-delicious drinks. The prices surprised me, but they're typical for the area. Also, the dessert (sans whipped ""cream"" but I'll get to that later) was amazing. I could drink the praline sauce and die a happy woman.

Cons: It's probably our own fault for doing a coupon on top of a coupon, but the ""Three Course Meal"" menu was incredibly under-whelming. For one, the first option was either a salad or gumbo, and we had just sampled the gumbo on our tour. It'd be great if something else was offered, since we'd already had their gumbo. For the second course, I ordered the ""Blackened Catfish"" and my fiance got the ""Blackened Chicken Pasta"" (the other option was a po'boy, which we'd already sampled on our tour--we wanted something different!). The chicken was so bland. Our tour guide warned us that many restaurants shied away from over-seasoning since tourists can't stand it, but the watery alfredo was disappointing. My catfish tasted incredible but was a bit undercooked. However, it was perfectly seasoned. I nibbled at the sides but the rice was very dry and I'm not a huge fan of collard greens, so I mostly just ate the fish. Finally, the bread pudding with praline sauce, which our server assured us was the best thing on the dessert menu. And yes--it was tasty! However, the whipped ""cream"" definitely was NOT cream. It tasted like someone just pipped cool whip onto the plate, and it separated as it melted on the hot bread pudding. Gross. I'd come back for the pudding, but definitely ask for no cream.

Overall, it was not the most memorable meal we had during our stay. However, the prices are reasonable for the area, and other reviews seem to suggest our experience wasn't typical. Next time perhaps I'll stop in for lunch and give them another go. In the meantime, I really suggest they take another look at their Taste of Nawlins menu.",2016-06-21 18:35:13

I've always had to ask for a little container with lemons for my leftover Catfish but not this time, he thought of everything! The Catfish was amazing! When he brought my plate out I thought he was at the wrong table because the pieces were so big that they looked like chicken strips. They lightly battered the fish so it wasn't too thick or greasy ( I hate when they use too much batter.) and it was seasoned perfectly. The strips were all white meat none of that weird looking gray fish meat. I almost thought that it was some other kind of fish like Mahi-Mahi or something because it was so good.

He was very attentive, accommodating and very personable! Also, my table was next to the kitchen so occasionally the cook would stick his head out and tell us jokes or just do some entertaining bits with fire and whatnot. Pretty fun atmosphere! And for the food, I shared the Taste of New Orleans sampler with my boyfriend. To be honest, I ate like 97% of the plate and he took like 3 bites. I loved it and have been craving it ever since!

We made the effort to eat seafood each night. We went to Oceana our 3rd night and it was by far our least favorite dining experience in New Orleans.

We ordered the chargrilled oysters. I was disappointed at the size of the oysters compared to other restaurants in the area (notably Acme). Additionally, we felt as though the sauce was less than complimentary.

While there were a few highlights of our meal, for seafood in New Orleans - head elsewhere!

I ordered the redfish. Now, part of this problem is their menu. It failed to describe that the fish was pan-fried. After having a few poboys that week, I was looking forward to getting away from a breaded fish.  I was disappointed when it came to our table. Also, the veggies were soft and mushy. On the positive side, the crawfish sauce was delicious.

My friend ordered the tuna from the menu. Unfortunately, we had very poor service that evening and the server brought their tuna special from the evening. Being a nice person, my friend didn't speak up but still wasn't impressed by the tuna steak. However, she was in love with the side of jambalaya.

I had a crepe stuffed with. oysters and crab meat. It was nice and spicy. I had hopes that the mere knowledge of the spiciness of the food would deter my wife from ""taste testing""(as she calls it). Naturally this was in no way a deterrent. I was forced to aquiesce a portion of my crêpe. For my sacrifices I entertained and procured several glasses of liquid fortitude.

My first choice was a  Sazerac.which consisted of  Rey whiskey, peychaud bBitters, and a ""whisper"" of Herbsaint. This was quite good and I was considering another one, being that the table was a bit unsteady and gravity was very good that day. However, I decided that I should try The Rajun Cajun Bloody Mary. This was  infused Absolut Peppar Vodka w sundried tomatoes, cocktail onions, spice green olives. Veeerry good!
I assured my wife that this was after all a health drink (of sorts) having vitamins and minerals not to mention the CH3CH2OH (the reason for its existence). She was not amused with my deliberations for some reason.

Our server was very courteous and prompt. He helped guide us through the menu and was very informative. He knew the menu items and rattled off the ingredients. With his help we made some very good choices. The meal was served in good sized plates. My crepe filled the dish completely. Very impressive. Matter of fact I could not consume it all, even with the aid of my helper. I got togo boxes for my wife's meal as well. She did not want breakfast and got a lunch item. However, her fork hovered over my plate quite a bit. I was able to chase her away with a few drops Louisiana Hot sauce on the remainder of my crepe.

 This was a fun place to eat at. This establishment has a lot of atmosphere. The food was very good.

I looked online to see their menu and I thought everything was pretty reasonable priced. They also had vegetarian options for my friend, which is always a plus!

Once getting seated, we opened up the menu and I was surprised! Their menu online vs their physical menu were different. The prices had been spiked and some plates were missing. We were a little disappointed at that. We asked the waitress if the menu has recently been changed and she said yes but it's been months. We let her know that the menu online did not reflect the physical menu and it was misleading. She apologized. 

The oysters were spiked an additional $5 which I thought was a bit absurd. I've had Louisiana oysters in South Carolina for a fraction of the price and they were great! Maybe they're not ""in season"" but neither were they a couple weeks ago in South Carolina, but I digress. 

The vegetarian menu was lacking dishes that were on their online menu. Thankfully the waitress was able to make those dishes for my friend. I ordered the Crawfish Etouffe which was good but again over-priced.

UNIMPRESSED.  my friend got two small, mushy crabcakes for $14, waaaaay too expensive. blackened duck was just as tough as ramsey noted on the show, and actually made me sick last night and this morning.. so, um... thats not a good sign about the kitchens being cleaner. boyfriend had some fish that he of course ate all of, no prob, but overall, we paid 60 plus tip ( our waiter was super nice!) for a not very decent meal. 

So, a lot of the reviews here are from tourists who had a quick trip down here and were seduced by the amount of new orleans-y food on the menu, and didnt get to taste a decent version of the real thing. this place should not be getting good reviews.
I dont want to suggest other restaurants to go to.. there are so many...
but this really was the most over-priced, shabby meal i've had down here.
some of the more famous restaurants in the quarter should probably be a best bet, they probably wont even be more/ much more expensive with a much better atmosphere. for something more authentic/local, i would suggest looking for some restaurants in uptown... like ignatius, that have been reviewed by locals. we love ya'll coming down! so dont eat there! blech... back to the restroom...",2011-06-24 16:47:45

As with most restaurants in the area, their seafood is top notch and fresh. It's odd that I don't get that living next to the ocean myself!

Grilled Oysters? ... ""Yes, please!""  
Cream sauce finish... ""Who Dat?""

I realize that they need to differentiate themselves from the mainstream but this grilled oyster fan gives Oceana a big thumbs down. The grilled oysters comes out with a sad hunk of bread smothered in the cream-butter-cheese sauce over a weird bed of wilted lettuce. (Hot oysters and lettuce?)

The seafood gumbo (bowl, $10) had an okay base but then it had four sad shrimp in it. Where's the seafood?

Both the Étouffée and Gumbo were served with three thin slices of the same sad French bread. :(. Not even toasted rounds. Honestly, saltine crackers would have been better.

She gave him some sauce for it and extra lemon though. Overall I'd say it's a place to try as a tourist but don't have high expectations.",2017-01-26 23:50:58

Maybe learn to balance salt with the food. You can't always rely on salt to make up for the not so amazing skills of your cooks. Hire a home cook. Most restaurants want experienced cooks but we all know (I hope) that most restaurants give people ONE JOB so while they have restaurant skills, it's very limited.

We had the Taste of New Orleans (seafood gumbo, crawfish étouffée, and beans & rice), Fried oyster po boy, jambalaya pasta, and seafood platter. All the dishes were definitely overly salted and greasy. I could barely taste the natural flavors of the ingredients, the sauces were overpowering and salty. Furthermore, the portions were small for the prices (bill was $100). The fried seafood platter had more breading than seafood and the hush puppies were hard. Like other reviewers mentioned, the seafood didn't taste fresh. However, the waitress was very friendly and we were seated promptly even though it was very busy. The food looks presentable too before you taste it! Don't be deceived!!!! If this is your first experience with New Orleans' cajun/creole cuisine, it will definitely be a bad first impression and very poor representation of what New Orleans has to offer!

Went and started off with the alligator sausage, something I've never had but never afraid to try need things and being from NYC you don't really see that much. So glad I got it! It was wonderfully smoked and anyone who tells you this tastes anything different than a good smoked meat is lying cause you would never know the difference.

On to the entree, I had the crawfish etoufee, a perfect sized portion. This one was more of a tomato based unlike the others I've seen served but that was fine because it was very good. My mom, sick of seafood all week, had the 1/2 rack of bbq ribs. A very nice portion and also very good, meaty ribs. 

For dessert we really had wanted bread pudding but like other places around we saw that they made it with cocktail fruit inside which we were very put off by.

There were plenty of open tables yet. I did notice things were getting busier by the time we left about an hour later. 
We were seated immediately upstairs and our waitress greeted us pretty quickly. We ordered an app and drinks and my daughter's main meal, all of which arrived quickly. After putting in the meal order, that arrived quickly, as well. 
Everything was pretty good. I had a couple bites of the alligator appetizer and the Taste of New Orleans. The alligator was chewier than I remember it being the one other time I had it years ago in an Illinois-based restaurant. It was still tasty, however. The Taste of New Orleans was very yummy, but...I think I built it up too big in my head. The red beans and rice w/ sausage was great. The jambalaya was darn good, as well. However, the etouffee fell a little short for me and, sadly, it was the number one item that I was looking forward to. I used to make etouffee fairly regularly (haven't in some time due to a particular picky eater I have the pleasure of calling my daughter...not walking headfirst into that standoff...lol) and I'm not one to brag about my cooking skills, as they are not Top Chef worthy by any means, but my etouffee would beat the pants off the Oceana Grill's etouffee. There was no spice (not the tiniest kick) and it was overly salty. I'm not going to say it was downright terrible because it was definitely not. I was just expecting it completely make mine look like amateur hour and, instead, it was the total opposite result. I guess, as they say, two out of three ain't bad, right??
Would I recommend this place? Absolutely. I may, however, suggest you skip the etouffee.",2018-10-25 15:52:57

It came highly recommended and apparently was a restaurant my friends had been to once before while visiting.

I ordered the gumbo and crab cakes. The gumbo was okay; there was too much okra for my taste. The crab cakes were full of crab meat like just the way I like them but they came out warm like they had been sitting for a while. I also tried a Rockerfeller Oyster off my friend's plate.

I am not sure why there was a long line on Saturday night, and why it had such great reviews on Yelp. 

We got seated outside in the patio, and our waiter provided pretty good service. He gave us several recommendations, and we ended up ordering the Cajun Jambalaya Seafood Pasta and Taste of New Orleans, both of which he recommended. 

The Cajun Jambalaya was alright, nothing really to complain about. But the Taste of New Orleans was a big disappointment. It had crawfish etouffee, red beans and rice, and Creole Jambalaya. The red beans and rice, were literally red beans and rice. It was so dry it tasted something I could've gotten at Chipotle... I was so glad I didn't just order red beans and rice and felt really bad for the table next to us, who got two orders of just red beans and rice.. they probably didn't know that's what they were getting themselves into. The crawfish in the crawfish etouffee were mushy, telling me that the crawfish was not fresh.. 

I seriously don't understand why this place got so many reviews and such a high rating. I don't think we ordered the wrong thing either since our waiter said their Cajun Jambalaya Seafood Pasta probably has the best reviews... 

Probably another tourist trap. If you want good cajun/creole food, go to other places in the FQ.",2017-06-04 23:58:39

Over and over, the locals kept telling us to go to this place. Our valet guy showed us his Instagram account and it showed his various lunch dishes at Oceana Grill. We were sold!!!!

I was shocked to see that I walked by this restaurant multiple times and I never realized that it was right off Bourbon St.  As we were walking up to the door, we noticed that there was a long line, but were quickly advised that the wait was only 20 Mins. We went ahead and stood in line and were seated in the time frame promised. BTW, be prepared to stand outside while you're waiting(rain or shine!).

We were seated right past the bar in Errol's area and I'm glad we were seated there. Still was very attentive and was great at making recommendations. We started off with their famous oysters and they were a total hit. They had a separate bar that prepped all of their oysters.  It was fun watching all the oyster dishes being prepped.

Oh, how can I forget the drinks?!??? My hubby ordered the Hurricane and wow, that sucker was strong!!!!!! Like SUPER strong. My brother orders the Bloody Mary and I have to say that it's the best Bloody Mary that I've tasted. Of course it's topped off with a pickled green bean. AMAZING!!!

Now onto our main entrees. I ordered the catfish poboy. Oooiii, the remoulade makes the dish! It was amazing. My hubby ordered the fried shrimp and he said that they were fresh and just amazing.  My brother ordered the Taste of New Orleans and the best thing in that dish was the beans and rice. I could just eat and that all by itself!!! I remember that as being the best dish ever!!!

The atmosphere of the place was typical New Orleans. This means that it's quirky and fun.

These are maybe 75-80% but the flavor was amazing. I actually appreciated the breading and sauce it was paired with. The platter was an ignorant amount of food for one person lol.

This is a place that survives because it has great atmosphere in the most tourist-dense part of the city (~10 steps off Bourbon St), and its kitchen is open a lot later than most places.  The atmosphere is really great and the bar has a good selection.  The waitstaff is friendly too.

So why am I only rating 2 Stars out of 5?  Because they skimp on the food.  Tonight I had a fried catfish Po Boy.  Let me tell you, they know what they're doing.  Great slaw, well-seasoned catfish, nice bread... except that there were FOUR catfish nuggets on a piece of bread that should have held 10-12 (it was 9"" long; I was dumbfounded enough to measure).  Why so little catfish?  Because that's the expensive item on the plate.  The catfish nuggets were placed about 1.5"" apart to spread them evenly across the bread.  You have to be kidding me!  I crowded all the catfish into the first half of the sandwich and ate that, leaving the rest.

As I was waiting for the bartender to run my card I heard a middle age couple say to each other on their way out how glad they were to find this place with authentic New Orleans seafood.  As I said, they're surviving on tourists who don't know they're skimping.  The food itself *is* delicious, you just get ridiculously small amounts of actual food in a plate filled with filler.

It sort of set the tone for the rest of the meal... the shrimp was hard as a rock, almost if they had battered some shrimp cocktails and fried it up. So hard and rubbery.  Then there was the catfish... soft on some parts but definitely could tell it was frozen, not fresh.

We inquired about the whereabouts of the oysters and got a chilly response from the bartender.  I said I had worked in the restaurant business for 10 years and this was kind of unacceptable.  She then asked me to name the places that I worked.  I told her there were several places in Atlanta and she smirked and said well, that's not here.  Wow... nice attitude.  Finally after my friend had finished his sandwich, my oysters arrived.  They were decent but the nasty exchange and now having to eat by myself, certainly left a bad taste.  There was no apology and definitely no comping of anything.  As we left and were walking out, a whole tray of food was spilled in the entrance way.  

I don't know but won't be going back again.  Good food is the priority but crappy service will change your view.",2019-02-16 00:04:27

We made a reservation for a Saturday early dinner, but showed up about 30 mins early and were seated right away. The restaurant has a sort of pub atmosphere but a creative and extensive menu. It's right in the middle of French Quarter.

We ordered the crab cakes for an appetizer and wow! I'm from Rhode Island and have had crab cakes in Baltimore, but this was the best crab cake I've ever had. There was plenty of crab meat, and the sauce on top was full of flavor and complemented it perfectly. 

For my entree, I ordered the Cajun jambalaya pasta and it was also delicious! There was plenty of shrimp and gator, the pasta was cooked perfectly, and the flavor of the sauce was very unique. 5/5 would recommend. 

Finally, for dessert we ordered the bread pudding with a side of vanilla ice cream. I wish it had fewer raisins but it was still very warm and moist. 3 days later and I still think about this bread pudding! 

Our server (Brad?) was excellent and made great recommendations. The prices of everything was very fair for the quality and portion size you get. Overall, we had a great experience and will likely return.",2018-12-12 12:04:20

But there's no way the shrimp creole that I ordered would of been made properly and delivered to me in 5 min, I obviously got late night left overs.... When I opened my meal.. It was a sloppy mess and the sauce was coming out of the sides of the container...

Oceana certainly caters to the Bourbon St. tourist crowd with its cheesy decor, matching waiter attire / scripted welcoming, etc.  Aside from the food, there doesn't seem to be much that's genuine about this place...

But... there's the food.  I ordered the New Orleans sample plate thing... yes, VERY touristy of me, I know.  However, it might have required a scanning electron microscope to detect any food particles left on my plate.  Maybe I was starving?  Maybe I psychologically wanted the food to be so damn good that I would hoover my dish?  Maybe it was just a really, really tasty stuff!

I'd really like to go back to Oceana, but the area is so congested with obnoxious people and hyper-touristy venues, that I just don't feel like dealing with it.

I had the crawfish etouffee. Holy moly! I'm now a diehard etouffee lover! It was so flavorful and hearty. I'm so glad I split it with my girlfriend or else I would have had to be rolled out of there. My husband, who is not a fish lover, thought it was so delicious too. He said he would order it next time. 

The hubs got the blackened chicken poboy. Again, another winner! The chicken was soft, packed with spice and one of the best sandwiches he'd ever have. Since then, he has challenged me to learn how to make their poboys so I can make them at home. Ha! 

Yes, the service was slow but I must say how incredibly generous they were to let us in right before closing. On the contrary to that, we picked Oceana Grill thinking if they were closing that they'd be faster. Sadly, we were very wrong. Oh well... it was totally worth it. 

I must point out our waiter. He was courteous and entertaining. He was apologetic for the kitchen's lag time and accidentally sending out the wrong dish for my friend. We know it wasn't his fault yet he took ownership showing great professionalism and customer service.

My wife ordered blackened chicken and I had the special both were amazing options. We were stuffed else the praline brownie was calling our name.

We drove from Texas and were hoping to find somewhere with non-seafood options for my taste. We ended up going twice during our visit. The food is so flavorful and well prepared. The atmosphere is lacking a little, but the food is worth the long line on weekend nights. 

I always get blackened chicken with a side of jambalaya and corn maque choux. It's a cajun corn dish that I've tried replicating at home. It's got a nice kick and is packed with flavor. Their jambayla is a mildy spicy mix of chicken and sausage with a sweet undertone. My partner and I inhaled the stuff. 

The blackened chicken is too good for words. The cut of chicken is cooked so wonderfully that it can be cut easily with a spoon. I don't know how they do it. Every time I'm blown away by how good the seasoning is and am reminded that I actually like meat when it's cooked this well. It's mildly spicy and won't burn the mouth of someone who doesn't do spicy food. 

My partner had a seafood chowder our 2nd visit and liked it a lot. We also ordered a side of hush puppies which I thought were too small and dry. That's my only criticism for Oceana.

$05.00 - Crawfish Etouffee: not bad but not unique, not dark or developed enough

$02.20 - Sweet Iced Tea: it wasn't sweetened. I'm not sure how you mess-up sweet tea but...

Finally was told by Uber driver that they could not get to me, due to road closures from parades.  My friends had left (we did not know there would be an issue with Uber getting to me). I needed to walk a block to the corner to meet a driver.  There were some people between me and the corner that made me feel uncomfortable to walk alone.

Alligator tail bites were good. We tried both blackened and fried. Blackened won out by far, much more flavorful, I'm my opinion. My sister liked them fried better. . I ordered the Cajun jambalaya pasta, definitely less in the Cajun arena, tons of shrimp, not much sausage. I've had better pasta at Fridays ... My sister had the blackened ribs and fries. The ribs were really good, I think the sauce overpowered the great blackened flavor of the ribs but overall they were decent. I had a piña colada, I had to order an extra shot of rum to cut the sweetness -I also added water eventually. Just way too sweet. My sister had a strawberry margarita, she liked it! ...

Came into town for my birthday and we were STARVING so we decided to just keep walking down the street and go to the next restaurant we saw and this place popped up. Now let's hit a side note real quick. (I do not...I repeat do NOT eat seafood) yes I know why come to NOLA but it was a surprise and I decided to roll with it. Back to the review walked in and I'm going to be honest the atmosphere does not match their prices. Let's be honest. I thought I'd be paying 10 bucks for a plate of pasta. Not the case! I got the chicken Alfredo and it was creamy and garlicy and full of divine goodness. It was so delicious and so awesome I finished the entire bowl and licked the plate clean (not really but I could have and it would've tasted amazing. Don't judge me) I ordered a hurricane (not knowing I could get one on the street for a few bucks cheaper) and it was tasty..not strong like I like it but tasty. All in all I got my ticket and it was like 25-30 bucks. For one plate and a drink I was kind of like ehhhhh...but it was worth it. Service was BEYOND excellent. The people there were so friendly. Omg I could go on and on but I'll stop here. Trust your gut and my review and try this place.

Gorden Ramsay did a makeover of this place so I had hoped that would have improved the food but I continued to hear mixed reviews but not as many terrible ones.  This was one of the very few places open and the only place serving their full menu on the day after Hurricane Isaac landed so they get one extra star for that.  They also housed their staff above the restaurant during the storm so that also deserves credit for excellent planning. 

The tail end of Isaac was still blowing pretty good when a friend and I decided we needed a nice post storm meal and this seemed to be our only option for a nice dinner so we decided to try it.  When we first arrived there was a line of folks waiting to get in but we were able to get to the bar and enjoyed an island of normalcy amidst the chaos of the storm.  The service was very organized and efficient in dealing with the many people waiting to eat.  Unfortunately the area where they really underperformed was the most important area and that was their food.  The best way to describe this food is that it's like Copeland's but a lot less good.  My friend and I ate multiple things and none of the items really tasted good to us.  The BBQ shrimp were the most edible things served.  The seafood gumbo tasted funky, the redfish was not fresh and had zero flavor, and sadly the cheesecake was the absolute worst I've ever had.  My friend and I agreed that the fried seafood options would probably be the best thing to get here in the unlikely event we ever returned in the future.  

I really want to give this restaurant a good review as I'm very impressed with their superior planning and execution of their hurricane plan but the food really failed to deliver.  I would like to hope that the disappointing food was due to the chaos of the hurricane but they never lost power and they had a full staff so that would be a difficult argument to make.  I'm very thankful that they were open and I got to at least eat dinner as later in the afternoon I met a lot of folks that were hungry that weren't able to find anything to eat so the food here was definitely better than no food.  During normal circumstances and for the price there are much better quality experiences to be had all over the Quarter than this place but during a hurricane this might be your best bet.",2012-09-04 14:28:28

With a myriad of choices in this dazzling city, we happened to find Oceana Grill through Yelp.  For some reason, everything is around 4-5 stars here, so we had a hard time actually choosing a good restaurant.  Oceana came on our radar based on proximity to our hotel, late hours, and how promising the photos looked!  It was acceptable NOLA fare, but I'm sad to say that it was actually one of the lesser meals of the trip.   

Note to readers: I like my food natural, lightly flavored, and fresh.  I like tasting each facet and individual flavor of a dish with every bite.  That being said, I found everything here too saucy and overpowering.  My friend and I each got a cup of seafood gumbo and we shared a dozen oysters on the half shell (half Rockefeller, half Oceana).  The Oceana was far too rich and creamy with a garlic and cream cajun sauce smothered in cheese.  Rockefeller was tastier in my opinion, but still overly sauced.  It came with spinach, smoked bacon, and pernod liqueur with cheese on top.  With all those strong flavors, it's no wonder I couldn't taste the freaking oyster!  The gumbo was okay, although again, I thought it was overly salted.  There was a generous amount of seafood in the gumbo, though, which I appreciated.  Service was very great; our waiter was helpful and refilled our water often.

They were blackened, spicy, and came with an awesome remoulade dipping sauce. I also tried the gumbo here, which was pretty good, but perhaps not my favorite Cajun dish. Of course, we also had to try the Oceana's Famous Oysters, because why eat at any restaurant in Nawlins and not order oysters?  These were probably my favorite char-grilled oysters in the city. They were cajun spiced, garlicky, and sprinkled with parmesan cheese. Sheer perfection. The prices at this restaurant were very reasonable, like many other spots in this quaint city.

I'm giving the place 2 stars because our waitress was very nice and she felt bad that i hated the crab cake.  They took my dinner off the bill.  I ordered a small bowl of gumbo, which was also not good.",2011-02-26 03:15:55

First time was fine, but not remarkable, but I thought I would give it a second try thinking maybe just did not order whatever it is that draws the crowds. 

Went on a Sunday night.  We had reservations, so we walked past the long line waiting outside.  We had to wait about 15 minutes for our table, but that isn't unexpected on a busy night.

We were seated but then waiting a notable amount of time for a waiter.  We ordered the ""famous oysters"" appetizer, a shrimp poboy, an oyster poboy, and a Greek salad with shrimp.  The oysters were very good.  I assume their grilled  oysters are the primary draw, but unless ordering a huge number, hard to make a meal on them. 

When the entrees came, they brought my daughter a shrimp poboy instead of oyster. We realized this after the runner left them, so we notified the woman who was working the station next to us (not our waiter who we did not see).  She said she would get us the right dish. 

No replacement came and our daughter said it was ok if my wife and I began eating.

About midway through our meals, we finally saw our waiter again (first time since we ordered).  We let him know and he took my daughter's incorrect plate. 

As my wife and I were finishing our meals the correct poboy finally came with no real apology. 

The salad was fine and the poboys were fine but nothing special.  The bill arrived with no adjustment.  As we by this time wanted to get going we paid and left.  We had been thinking of dessert, but that wasn't even offered to us.  We did get a drink refilled, but not by our waiter as it was during the time of his long absence. 

Much better choices nearby for same price and better quality.",2019-02-18 12:44:08

I had their house special Red Fish. The flavor was good but you could tell the fish, the greens, and the mashed potatoes has all been cooked hours ahead and served up from chafing dishes. So everything was buffet line temperature and quality. That was disappointing but not unexpected given the location off Bourbon St and what you can get away with when +90% of your business is from tourists who won't be returning.

It must just be me, I don't think I care for the spice that everything in New Orleans seems to be made with.  I don't know what this spice is.  It's not garlic or even jalapeno because there's not really a ""taste"" to it..  It's just spicy.

Anyway, the breading on the boyfriend's shrimp tasted the same as my crab cake, which tasted the same as the mushroom sauce they put on the crab cake.  So there was no real flavor to the food, other than this ""spiciness"".  I liked the first bite of his jalapeno hushpuppy.  But after the first bite, the ""spice"" overtook the flavor of the jalapeno and it ended up tasting just like everything else.  I did like the coleslaw and the pecan pie though.

Not being a NOLA native (in fact, I'm a Yankee in every sense of the word) I had a hankering for some Cajun cooking.  After all, isn't that what NOLA is known for?  At one point or another, our sources (more like acquaintances) guided us to the Oceana Grill.  It was heeded as having some excellent variety so we could get a taste of the city.  Boy did it ever.

If elegance is what you're looking for in YOUR New Orleans dinner location, look elsewhere.  Oceana is a loud, crowded, eclectic little picnic party of a restaurant (As I recall there were even plastic covers donning each table top).  If you've had a few hand grenades, you won't even notice anyway.

The service is fast.  When I say fast, I mean, I had a steaming hot dinner placed in front of me about five minutes after I ordered it.  On top of that, I also received an amazing amount of southern hospitality from our waiter, all with a friendly smile on his face.  Speed and hospitality is a bonus, since on weekends (especially dinner time) you'll more than likely wait in a 20 or 30 minute line JUST to get into the joint.  Well.  Worth.  It.

I ordered the fried catfish platter and my girlfriend had the ""Taste of New Orleans"" which included gumbo, crawfish and a variety of other Cajun creations all mixed up in one bowl.  We decided to share.

The catfish was perfection.  Lightly fried with French fries on the side, it was soul food paradise.  I've had catfish before (strictly in the New York area) but let me tell you, one you've had Oceana's, you'll finally have something to compare all others to.  The portion was HUGE so be sure you bring your appetite.

My girlfriends ""Taste of New Orleans"" was even better!  I can't even count the amount of different tastes they were able to fit into one big bowl of goodness.  It was spicy and Cajun inspired, but not so much so that it lit my mouth on fire.  That said, it was certainly the better dish of the two, and I had wished I ordered it instead, but none the less, both were superb.  

If you don't settle on either of those entrees, the menu is giant so you'll easily be able to find another dish that suits your fancy.

Everything was extremely affordable.  I believe $40 including tax and tip.  For what you get, it was a steal.

Oceana is convenient, clean, delicious and, with so many excellent Cajun seafood restaurants in the area, very worthy of your time and money.",2010-03-09 21:33:12

Came here for dinner after a work conference and Oceana was the only restaurant that didn't have a wait time at 7:30 on a Monday. The restaurant has three levels, and looked fairly dirty and dark. 

Onto the food and service -

Service - with a smile, but the waitress messed up on our order twice, and brought us out the wrong drink order twice as well. They delivered our food to the table next to us, even though they were eating their desserts. 

Food - Luke warm and bland. We ordered the jambalaya, blackened fish, and their special, but none of us were impressed, and all of the food came out cold. The waitress warned me that my jambalaya would be spicy, but when I tasted it, it literally tasted like tomato sauce with vegetables...poor. 

The one unique thing about them was that they had 3 dishes catered to just vegetarians, which is rare in NOLA, and even rarer in the French Quarter.

Highly recommend if your party is 1-2, and you're ok not having all the atmosphere. 

First thing I saw coming my way was a Hurricane drink that a couple ordered. It was literally smoking. Yes, I'll had one of those. I ordered a bowl of gumbo and the crab cake app. The bar server pointed out the size of a bowl of gumbo. It was more like a throth - cup it is. 

Food came within 10 mins. So glad I ordered the cup, which is some restaurants' bowl. The gumbo had a balance of shrimp rice and roux, but that was pretty much it. It was underwhelming and I wouldn't go back just for it. To be fair, in my years, I've had pretty amazing gumbo, some in restaurants, but mostly bowls of richness made by folks from Louisiana, South Carolina, and Texas, by some Creoles and Gheechees, and some proud-ass AL-Bamas and Atlantans (transplants tho). With that, take my comment from that perspective. The crab cakes were good, but I could only eat one. There were huge! The other was a nice lunch the next day.

I also was disappointed to not see macaroni and cheese on the kids menu (my daughters go to) so we paid $7 for some mozzarella sticks. 

Overall, good New Orleans experience to get the southern food we were looking for. A huge positive- draft beers were excellently priced at just $5, much lower than normal restaurants! Good ones too!",2019-06-17 02:23:40

My wife noticed you could order the BBQ Shrimp as an appetizer or as a meal. The appetizer was five shrimp for $8. The meal consist of 10 shrimp with no sides for $20. 
Since my wife had never had Oceana's BBQ Shrimp she ordered the $8 appetizer. Once she determined she did like their BBQ Shrimp, I offered to split another order. So we ended up getting 10 BBQ Shrimp for $16.00. 
I ordered the Crab Cakes appetizer ($14). On the menu the Crab Cakes were marked as an Oceana favorite. IMO these were average at best. The Crab Cakes were fried to the point of having a hard outer shell. The Crab was shredded and mealy not lump Crab. I would not order them again. 
My wife rarely drinks alcohol, but did order a Mojito ($7).  She said her drink was very good.

The food is mediocre and it just looks like a tourist trap.  Now maybe there are better dishes here that I didn't try but based off what I had and have heard since eating here, do yourself a favor and eat somewhere else! I ate here on the suggestion of the valet at my hotel. I asked for great gumbo and he sent me here. Note to self: if your valet hands you a card for a discount to a restaurant, go somewhere else. 

Anyway, I tried the gumbo and the blacked shrimp Caesar salad. This gumbo is NOT roux based and if it is, then it's the lightest roux in the world or they spent 5 minutes making it. I'm partial to a deep, rich roux gumbo with chicken, andouille sausage, okra & rice. This gumbo was not that. It looked more like a tomato based broth with rice and two different types of shrimp. There was't a whole lot of flavor that you'd expect from a great gumbo, heck, even a good gumbo!

Next I had the blackened shrimp Caesar salad (again on recommendation). This one was hardly edible. They were heavy handed on adding the blackening seasoning to the shrimp. I couldn't even taste the shrimp. The Caesar dressing had some odd Cajun seasoning added in, which over powered the salad as well. None of the flavors blended well together and all I could taste was blackening. This salad would be so much better with the shrimp lightly blackened and a traditional Caesar dressing that compliments to shrimp instead of competing. 

Now, with all of that said... the bartender Allison was amazing and the reason why I'm giving them 2 stars at all. She was friendly, attentive and fun to talk with.",2018-10-05 10:17:53

I usually only remember waiters or waitresses names after the meal if they were terrible or great. This guy mike was terrible. He was pushy and I was not thrilled of how he spoke to me. He asked if we had questions and I asked if the menu still had turtle soup and he kind of laughed and said no. Which was fine but he continued like it hasn't been on the menu in years which is not true since I have been to Oceana a few times and the last time I went which was last year they did. But he treated me like I didn't know anything almost like a silly tourist which I am not but my parents are and his way of speaking to people was ridiculous.

The location is big and is on multiple levels. There is normally a line that forms outside and that is where you wait until your group is next.

I'm sure they make most of their money off of drunk tourists coming off Bourbon St. that know nothing about good seafood. 

A buddy and I were looking for a late night spot to eat dinner and this was the only place still open around the city. We sat down and our server told us they were famous for their crab cakes which I had intended on trying as well as the Oceana oysters. This was just the next mistake along with many more to come since choosing to dine at Oceana. 

Our oysters came out and were not sizzling like usual chargrilled oysters are, yet they were covered in a thick garlic sauce that can be described as gooey. The oysters themselves were incredibly chewy and after two I could touch anymore of the dozen in front of me. 

Shortly after, the crab cakes arrived and I had to send the first one back due to it being cold; upon biting into the crab cake I was appalled that a place in New Orleans can disrespect oysters and crab so horribly. Very little crab meat and mainly breading and onions, though the crawfish that came on top were not the worst I've ever had. I've had better frozen crab cakes from Walmart. 

Lastly, I ordered the special of the day (redfish Pontchartrain) and by this time I'm wondering to myself why we didn't leave when we first walked in and realized what type of establishment we were in. Alas, the fish came out and was somewhat blackened but the meat of the fish was tough and the shrimp onto in the cream sauce seemed frozen (like I'm sure most things from Oceana are). I pushed off the fish and tried a couple bites of the ""jalapeño cornbread"" that was more of a mush than a cornbread. That was it, I put my fork down and didn't eat another bite. 

If you have read this review and are thinking to yourself, ""well the other reviews sound good maybe he just has a vendetta against this place"" I urge you with every fiber of my being to try any of the hundreds of other seafood spots in the City, Peche for example is one of my favorites.

It's located off of Bourbon Street in the middle of French Quarter so I don't know if it's considered more of a touristy place, but they definitely made my food right.

The crabmeat cakes were exceptional, served with their special crawfish sauce.  Moreover, the cakes were full of crab which you could taste, not just breading at other places I've been to.  They were chunky and full of flavor.  

The Oceana Famous Oysters is a must have.  They take fresh shucked oysters, served with garlic, their house cajun sauce and cheese then grill it over an open fire until it all melts together.  Simply incredible and rivals Acme Oysters in my book.

The Seafood Gumbo was good too, served with a scoop of rice.  It was thick, creamy, and flavorful as a New Orleans Gumbo should be.  This one in particular, though was a little sweeter and had shrimp and seafood prominently in it.  Definitely did not disappoint!

For the most part the food was just fine. Definitely edible of course. I'm not sure if it's because I had really amazing oysters elsewhere why I wasn't in love with the famous oysters. The barbecue shrimp was fine too. 

I really enjoyed they strawberry beer though. It was very different and delicious.

Our main dishes blackened redfish and the Cajun jambalaya pasta were good too. I prefer them over the apps because of the price.

I was elated to find out recently that Oceana Grill is now the home of the chef and they were serving the same menu items that I missed dearly!  My wonderful boyfriend brought me there for our Valentine's/Who dat hangover brunch and we both high-fived when we saw that the menu still said ""Petunia's""!!  Absolutely everything was the same....Cha-ching!!

The ambience of Oceana Grill is everything that makes New Orleans unique....vintage pictures, antiques, and a beautiful courtyard!  There's a large dining area, so you're less likely to have a long wait.  Being a door off of Bourbon, even the bar looks cool enough to grab a drink to start off your night.

My Eggs St. Louis were delish....english muffin, poached eggs, fresh crab meat and a grilled tomato all smothered in creamy hollandaise.  The bf got an enormous crepe filled with shrimp, crab and cheese!!  Whatever you do...you need to order a side of hashbrowns because Oceana does 'em right!!

Chris promptly greeted us and told us the specials including a drink they called the hulk. I stuck with a Nola blonde. 

As we're sitting there I was thinking this place sounds familiar and I realized at some point someone told me to try it because it was on my list of yelp places to go. We started with the crab cake and it did not disappoint. Very dense and full of crab topped with crawfish tails and a mushroom cream sauce. I ordered the special which was a blackened red fish served over a corn and crawfish dressing with a creamy mushroom and crawfish tail sauce served over top. The same as the crab cake sauce. It had fried crawfish tail on top and a side of mustard greens. I will most definitely be bringing people here, and you need to stop in if you haven't. Great, knowledgeable server, decent prices for bourbon street, and it is definitely NOT a tourist trap so go try it.

Two words: Praline Duck

OMG. But let me back up...

My friend Anh and I initially entered and were seated near the front door, which turned out great for a spell because we were able to see and hear a brass parade going down the road! Seriously, that's one thing I adore about NOLA and which really sets it apart for me.

Once my husband arrived to join us, we asked if there was seating out on the patio. We were guided to a table in a central courtyard where we were surrounded by historic walls and windows going up a few stories. So the environment was already on a roll...

Enter the FOOD. Now, I don't normally gravitate toward duck, but I was in New Orleans and wanted to try something outside of my norm. When my eyes lighted on the words ""Praline Duck,"" I was hooked.

I am here to tell you today that it was one of my top 10 meals ever consumed. I ate every.single.bite. It was a perfect blend of succulent and sweet. I even got that look on my face when my husband (a notorious duck-lover) swiped a bite.

Taste: 3 Stars
The oysters were seasoned very well, however, there were crunchy parts in about half of the ones we had. Just not the most quality oysters. Taste of New Orleans was delicious, but not very much spice going on. 

Service: 4 Stars 
Our waitress was great, but a little hard to flag down when we needed her. I'm sure this is just because the restaurant was so busy.

Price: 3 Stars
In general, this is a pretty expensive area for food so price is average for this area but I still don't feel like $20 for a dozen of oysters with inedible crunchy pieces in it is worth it. So, I'd say just skip the oysters. The taste of New Orleans was $18, and not a whole bunch of food. My boyfriend got the grilled ahi tuna for $24, but it was sushi grade fish. 

Overall: 3 Stars
We went to Oceana Grill for our last dinner in New Orleans but it was not as good as some of the places we went while on our vacation. I would definitely say this isn't reeeally worth coming back to next time. 

Still worth giving it a shot for yourself!

I ate at Oceana last year and I could not say enough good things, but this visit was extremely disappointing. I ordered shrimp Alfredo. I am not share if it was a bad night for them, but my food was terrible. My shrimp was over cooked and the Alfredo was somewhat runny. I was surprised because I had such a great experience last year. I am not sure if this was just a off night, but this was a must go to for me and quality completely went down.

I get the appeal of it, it's a large space, has fruity drink offers and is in the middle of the French Quarter, but I can't help but feel we got a little short changed eating here.

Again, a lot of classics on the menu with Gumbo, Jambalaya, Po Boys etc but everything just seemed like a watered down version for tourists, and even then the food was a bit lackluster 

We had some gator bites to start, which were probably the only good thing about the meal - well seasoned and good texture, served with a little Cajun aioli.

The gumbo 

Mains, as I say left a lot to be desired. I had the Fried Oyster Po Boy. The oysters were soggy and were served on some shitty saw dust like roll, with a little coleslaw and lettuce - and apparently that's a Po Boy. It was also served with fries... but like... so underwhelming and with no love or flavour. Something I'd expect from 7 eleven for $5.

My po' boy was OK- the bread was a bit stale, the fried oysters and shrimp were stuffed in with remoulade. We ordered waters when we sat because we were partied out and they took forever. The waiter was nice, but I just didn't find anything about this place that made me feel like i got anything unique and deliciously NOLA. Prices were fair.",2017-02-27 14:38:37

Derrick who works at the bar is amazing.  So professional and pleasant.  You can tell he takes pride in his work and doesn't let the small stuff get him down.

Same goes for San Antonio with Mexican Food, etc. You may be sick of cajun food by your third day here, but that shouldn't stop you from going to Oceana. It was legit!
We had a larger party, so we had to wait a little while for a table. There was a small wait. The hostesses were super nice and accommodating, so we all started at the bar with drinks. When we sat down, our waiter was nice enough and thoroughly explained the menu, specials and what not. He wasn't the friendliest person, but then again we were edging closer and closer to being THAT loud and obnoxious table on account of the free flowing drinks, so I digress.
The food! The food was awesome. We started with the Oceanas Famous Oysters. They were delicious. I realized while I was in New Orleans that my favorite way to eat oysters now is chargrilled. So amazing. I ordered the fried seafood platter and split it with another person, which was the right choice after drinks and appetizers. It comes with a lot of food - freshly fried oysters, shrimp, catfish and french fries. Everything was seasoned perfectly. We also ordered dessert, which was great too! The bananas foster pie was everything it needed to be, and tasted just like a cold, ice cream version of the dish. The creme brulee was also really good.

You know how it is, it can't be that good if it's that close...I rather walk some distance to find a better place was my thinking. Well, I will admit I was glad I went to Oceana Grill.

It really says N'awlins.  This place is cool, first of all it's 4 stories.  It's an old house, maybe a hotel now a restaurant.  It's got the old hardwood floors, the brick, we walked up 4 stories to the bar area and sat at the bar.  It was packed, which is a good sign but it was more than that, the waiters and waitresses were helpful, there was a positive aura you can feel, maybe it's the ghosts of past but whatever it was it made us happy to be there.

Best poo boy sandwich I had was there, and I kept trying other places all the top yelp recommendations, none lived up to this one.  My wife and I shared that with also the best seafood gumbo I had.

Don't pass this place up, it's got it all, great food, great atmosphere, great service.  Thank you to the staff at Oceana.

I have eaten here twice previously, once, several years ago when they first opened and then once about a year ago. My first experience was awesome and the food killer. The second time? Disgusting and I stopped sending customers here. I knew Gordon Ramsey had been here earlier this year and considering I  refused to send people here before, I decided to give them another chance.  It's obvious that they have chosen to follow none of Gordon's advice.  The inside is still dirty and dank and I opted for the courtyard. The ""ice cream parlor"" chairs in the courtyard were horribly uncomfortable, ugly and offered no ambiance to this otherwise awesome courtyard.  Maybe it was a subconscious way of the owner telling customers to get the hell out. This is obviously a place that makes it's money by turn and burn. I ordered the Redfish Oceana and at least I got a piece of redfish. It was however, breaded as a previous review noted. The sauce had crawfish tails in it that were previously frozen and came out a nasty grey color on my plate. Ick...I'm not eating those so I picked them off. Otherwise the redfish was ok.  The fried eggplant appetizer was pretty good. The big problem?, the menu is way overpriced for the style of food. $20 for the redfish and $8.50 for fried eggplant.  This isn't Palace Cafe after all. All and all, I still wouldn't send customers here. I wonder how long it will take these people to figure out that you cannot survive on tourists alone, especially when they are savvy food bloggers.

I got the seafood omelet which was okay but lacked spice, and the cheese it came with was only partially melted. The biscuit was dense and hard like it was warmed over from the night before. My knife had bits of food stuck to it and when I asked for another one, got another one with food stuck on it. My companion had the crab Benedict which left him with an uneasy stomach even though he skipped the hollandaise. The breakfast crowd included a cockroach that crawled into a crevice in the wall next to my chair. I would not recommend this place.",2016-10-24 00:10:30

As luck would have it, Oceana is located across from the Royal Sonesta. On Saturday morning, we waited 15 minutes at 12:30. 

Keep in mind, we were looking for Court of Two Sisters price, selection or ambiance but rather a decent meal with a little cajun flair with decent service and price. Oceana actually delivered on all accounts. Yes, the decor and ambiance is cheesy but we got  what we came for. 

The kids did a Country Breakfast (two eggs, hash brown, grits, biscuit and your choice of bacon or sausage for $11) and Classic Pancakes (three big fluffy ones with bacon or sausage for $10.50). My Cajun Breakfast with grilled Andouille and Alligator sausage with two eggs, grits, hash browns and a a biscuit for $13, really hit the spot.

My advise in regards to getting the food delivered; one, it makes no sense to write a message for the delivery guy he wont read it and I don't think he carries a phone either. He went into another office building with my order all bc he didn't read the message to call me. Two, check your order before he leaves, when he handed me the food I asked if he had the side of bacon he rushed me off and said that it was all in there. When I got to my desk, guess what wasn't with my order? Bacon! I called the restaurant, the man who I spoke to was very nice about the situation and he sent the guy back out with my bacon (they added two sausage patties). The omelet comes with hash browns and a biscuit. I got the seafood omelet, it wasn't bad actually, I think it would have been plenty for two people. Big pieces of shrimp and crawfish, I cant remember if it was suppose to have crab meat or not. The biscuit was little dry so I didnt try to eat it. The bacon was a little on the salty side (I know I know its bacon but there is a difference). 
Really, for the price you pay for the food I suppose it worth your money they haven't made a believer out of me honestly, but the food wasn't the worst breakfast food that I have had. If you go there more than once you should keep your receipt because you can get a free bloody mary or a mimosa with your next purchase and that's a plus.",2017-12-01 22:49:05

my sister wanted to come here because she was hungry after taking an afternoon nap (it was 9pm) LOL. she found this place online and she wanted to come here but i was at a bar with my sorority sisters so i came afterwards. she was still in line. she waited about 20-30minutes. by this time, i walked/ran to the restaurant which made my stomach not happy after having an open bar with bad alcohol. i wasn't drunk at all but by the time my sister and i were getting seated, i guess it hit me all at once and i became very nauseous and threw up right then and there inside , past the bar area , where we were about to sit (next to the bathroom hallway). the hostess was SUPER sweet about it and said not to worry and directed me to the bathroom, they cleaned the place in less than two seconds and acted like nothing happened when i came back out. (i guess they get this a lot since this place is open very late and it's right next to bourbon st haha)

anyways, since my stomach wasn't in great shape, i couldn't eat much so the food is based off of my sister who was telling me how everything was ( i only had a bite of each food option). the grilled oysters were good but not the best ( my sister devoured them though haha) and then we got the taste of new orleans which was the Creole jambalaya, crawfish etouffée, red beans and rice with smoked sausage for $16 which was all combined in one bowl which made it not as great since it just tasted like one big bowl of soup LOL. the food overall was just okay (not worth the wait) but the service is great and there's even a 10% off your order when you check in yelp so i guess if you want to try this place it's not bad!",2019-08-10 14:45:58

After searching, we decided Oceana was the best spot. Probably not the place I would have picked if it were a decent hour. But at 10:30 on a Sunday night, we were pretty limited. The service was great and so were the raw oysters. But that is pretty much where the good ended.

We decided to test out the BBQ Shrimp as an app in addition to the oysters. The sauce was not anything like I have had with other BBQ shrimp. It was too thick and sort of bland. For that reason, it did not flavor the shrimp at all. The shrimp were also overcooked and very difficult to peel. For $9 and 4 shrimp in the appetizer portion, it was highly disappointing. After the double appetizer, we decided to split the Redfish entree with eggplant sticks. The eggplant sticks were actually pretty good. But the fish was a little dry and overcooked. The only saving grace was the sauce that came on it. But even with creamy crawfish sauce, the fish was still a disappointment.

I teetered between a two and three star since the service was good and we enjoyed some things. But since the thing we enjoyed the most was something they didn't even have to cook, two stars is ultimately what this experience was.",2018-04-02 21:59:48

The restaurant is pretty huge with multiple levels. The menu consists of all of the Cajun classics you would expect: po'boys, gumbo, jambalaya, etc. Heavy on fried food and heavy on seafood.

I went with the alligator sausage po'boy which was something I'd never tried before. The sausage was 60% pork and 40% gator and it came with fries. What really diminished our dining experience was that the food took forever to come out. So long that I thought to myself, this is the longest I've waited for food at a restaurant in a while. When the food finally came out, my order was wrong. I had asked for only pickles and mayo on the po'boy and they forgot the pickles.

The chargrilled oysters were a first as well and I really enjoyed it. The sauce was creamy as opposed to the other chargrilled oysters that we had, which were more buttery. The Taste of New Orleans consisted of cup size servings of: Red beans and rice, Crawfish Etouffe and jambalaya.

I went in last Friday and I understand why this place was on Kitchen Nightmares. The wait staff was the worst kind of autistic - their social skills were lacking considerably. I mean seriously the guy serving us not only seemed uninterested in our experience (would a smile and ""how are you guys"" before taking our order have been hard?), he also forgot to give us silverware and napkins. After our food came out (which came out ten minutes a part), I asked another waiter for some napkins. Despite telling me ""sure thing"" as he headed to the bar behind us, he walked by us and either forgot or just decided having forks and napkins wasn't going to be a part of our experience - we were actually forced to go to the wait station and grab our own. I don't go to restaurants to serve myself. 

The food was basic. Nothing you can't get at a Taco Mac or Shuckers and extremely overpriced for Sysco bought food. 

The only redeeming elements of the whole night was the hostess (whose hair weave was on point) was extremely nice and the mens room was immaculate. I mean I was actually taken aback at how clean it looked and smelled (this is not a simple feat in the Quarter).

I'm at the bar sitting next to a lady. She orders fried fish and shrimp. I order a crab cake appetizer and we both just start talking.  Both agree our food lacks flavor but eat it. Her food is cold and has no flavor other than breading. My crab cakes taste eggy and fishy, as if they used old fish and too much egg to bind it to together. 

During the meal she pulls out a long hair out of her food that clearly didn't belong to her. To make matters worse, another lady walking out also asked her if she found a hair in her food.   At this point i ate one of my 2 crab cakes and literally lost the desire to eat any more. 

Jai, our bartender, and perhaps the only good experience I had at the restaurant got his manager. You would think at this point the restaurant would recover. Nope!  Daniel was a total ass.

Everything about this place was a red flag; the dubious location just off the tawdry Bourbon Street, the tacky gift-shoppy host station, the plastic laminated menus.

I wanted to turn heel and run but I was just too hungry. 

It was exactly as I thought it would be, just left of ok. The chargrilled oysters were a gummy affair that needed another few minutes in the broiler. The fried oysters in my po-boy were minuscule--mostly fried balls of batter with an oyster in there somewhere. The roll was a little chewy--I guess it sat out long enough for the humidity to take its toll. 

I'm sure to many a stumbling drunk who saunters in off Bourbon street this place must represent everything that a Cajun meal should.

Mo is a horrible person and owner. Rami has always been wonderful to me.  Kent(?) one of the managers, is really bad at his job and should move toward a different career. Tom, one of the managers, is excellent. 

Overall, with the exception of Rami,  I've seen the staff be horribly abused. It is difficult for me to support a company who treats my neighbors and fellow new Orleans residents like shit.  

The food is frozen... Simple fact. Nothing is fresh. Simple fact. You can taste the freezer burn.

There was actually a separate bar on this floor as well. Wait staff was excellent with timeliness, courteousness, and information regarding the menu! I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and the Mrs had the special of the day which was a redfish over a bed of some type of creamy spinach rice.

2/5 PoBoy - Really below my expectations. The fried oysters and slaw were above average. However, there was too much break vs the amount of oyster meat, so it made for a relatively dry-mouthed dish.  The fries are good...better if you come directly out of the Bourbon St parties, but frankly, nothing special here. 

Crawfish Etouffe - 5/5 this is a perfect dish. Had a good ratio of crawfish and was salted to perfection. I rarely go around to previous restaurants, but this is one to remember.

We ordered a cup of gumbo, the Taste of New Orleans dish ($17), and the fried oyster platter ($21) between 2 of us. Gumbo was the weakest of the dishes and would not order again. It was bland and also came out cold. We felt lucky we didn't order an entire bowl and just the cup. 

Taste of New Orleans is a great value. Comes with cup sample sizes of 3 favorites: jambalaya, red beans & rice with alligator sausage, and crawfish etoufee. Jambalaya was soooo good! Flavorful and came out piping hot. Crawfish was also good but quite dry. I enjoyed the red beans & rice more than I imagined. Would totally recommend!

We took the fried oysters to go. They were seasoned great but keep in mind it's a ton of salt. Served over a bed of regular fries and some hush puppies.

Overall, food is fairly priced given that it's seafood. Don't come here for service, but food is good and would recommend to others if you're in the area.",2019-10-31 16:54:07

My main course was a full rack of sticky, tender BBQ pork ribs.  They advertise them as fall-off-the-bone tender, which they ae not, but that was fine by me.  Good ribs should have a bit more chew and not be turned into baby food consistency, so I do believe tenderness is an over-rated quality in ribs.  That said, the chef came over to me when I was about  half-way through this massive serving and said she was concernd I was not enjoying them.  the reality was that I was quite full ,but she insisted on providing me something on the house, which turned out to be a free glass of wine.

A friend recommended and so glad he did. 

It all started with us walking up to a long line which surprisingly only took 20 minutes. The food and drink are worth waiting far longer if need be. TRUST ME! 

Once seated we started things off with a couple drinks and the alligator tail bites. Yes...I ate deep friend alligator and loved it. They marinate the alligator in Italian dressing for 24 hours so it's not rubbery or gristly either. The sauce they bring for dipping is also delicious. 

For drinks we had: 
""Oceana's Big Banana"" a bananas fosters ice cream cake blended with Bacardi Rum, Stoli Vanilla Vodka and Bols Banana liqueur and the ""Tropical Storm"" a Malibu Coconut Rum, Hpnotiq Liguor, Bols Blue Curacao and pineapple juice and it had dry ice in it so it arrived smoking it was so cool. 

For dinner we had the fried shrimp platter with crawfish tails (the jalapeño hushpuppies were awesome)and the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. Both were so delicious and flavorful. I added spicy crawfish tails to my pasta too. So good!

Honestly, at first, I was being a little skeptical because it is in the quarter right off Bourbon Street, so I wasn't sure if it's like ""tourist food"" if you know what I mean.  However, as my friends/family wanted to try seafood from New Orleans, it seems like this is the closest from where they stayed, so we decided to give it a go.  

The waiting line was long but it only really took us about 20 minutes.  Service was actually very efficiency and nice.  The last time we were there, the waiter was very nice and professional.  He was always smiling and checking on us at the right moment.

We ordered, Crawfish Etouffee, Fried seafood platter and BBQ shrimps to share. We added extra fried crawfish to the etouffee as suggested and it was fantastic.  The crawfish was clean and fresh.  The Seafood platter was great.  The fried oysters and catfish were soooo fresh and we were all very impressed.  Lastly, the BBQ shrimp, it was amazing.  I thought Pascal's BBQ shrimps was my favorite until I tried theirs.  Their BBQ shrimps are a little more tangy than the ones at Pascal, but I love them both.

The grilled pieces were moist and well seasoned. I just don't think I'm a fan of gator though.

Oysters were good, but every single bite, I bit into something hard, I don't know if it's the shell or something, it's just weird. Oysters shouldn't have anything hard like that. Taste of New Orleans consists of crawfish etouffee, jambalaya and rice red beans with smoked sausage. Crawfish etouffee is good, but not as good as other places. Jambalaya is just mediocre. I don't like red beans and sausage so no comment on that. 

We also had to wait for a loooooooong time to get our check. Actually we had to ask for one since they seemed to forget about us. If we didn't have anything else after that, I wouldn't mind the wait, but we had a tour after the meal and had to rush to our meeting point.",2018-11-22 19:38:40

I searched around for a restaurant that offered vegetables for an appetizer or side dish.  Many restaurants offered an abundance of seafood as you would expect but no vegetables.  I just do not feel right unless I have a serving of vegetables with my meal.  Oceana Grill offered vegetables as a side dish and a choice of two salads as an appetizer.  They were a solid four stars and away I went.

I walked there so that I could get a little exercise (just a little - 0.2 miles) and enjoy the sights and vibe in the French Quarter.  I admit that I walked by the restaurant twice because of the minimalistic sign.  I got there around 5pm and had no trouble being seated.  Instead of a table, I chose the bar since I was solo.  The bar staff were very friendly and engaging, but not so much that they were annoying.  The restaurant was clean but could use a little updating.  I noticed that the kitchen was open for viewing and mentioned to the bar staff that a kitchen side bar would do well since everyone seems to be into food these days.  I would have mentioned it to the manager but that would have taken more effort to locate them.

I ordered a beer and looked over the menu.  It was slightly different than their website with a couple of dishes removed.  I ordered the alligator tail bites appetizer and made a special request to have them split between the two available ordering options - blackened and fried.  That was no issue at all, thankfully.  Both versions were delicious, and the accompanied remoulade sauce was very nice. 

I am normally a decent eater but for some odd reason, I was full.  I had sushi for brunch earlier in the day and had no idea why I felt satisfied.  I was waffling between the Caesar salad with something blackened or the fried catfish with vegetables and Jambalaya.  I waited to regain my appetite but after ten minutes, nothing.

In summation, I would recommend Oceana Grill.  The next time I am in the Big Easy, I will try it again and hopefully make it past the appetizer.",2019-05-28 23:55:43

Eggplant sticks as an appetizer were interesting and quite good. 

Ribeye entree and vegetarian pasta = blah.

Like, 10 times more vegetables would have been an acceptable amount for ""vegetable pasta"".  Boo. The ribeye was okay, but served on a sad little plate with sad little sides that was nowhere near worth the $23 they charge.  We got the pecan pie to go and it was equally disappointing.  It's a Southern dish, right?  Then why was this pie the saddest pecan pie I've ever seen?  It was one single, sparsely laid layer of pecans over a giant portion of pecan pie group, and the whipped cream had no flavor.

I checked Yelp and quickly saw this restaurant and how many reviews it had with a almost 5 star rating.  We walked to the restaurant from our hotel Drury Inn and and was only a little uncomfortable because of the heat.  The first thing noticeable is the building which is I think 4-5 stories high with dining on each level.  Very very cool place!  I felt like I was getting a tourist visit and dinner in one.  The food was hot and amazing!  Very authentic New Orleans food which is what we wanted and it was delicious!  The only reason why I'm giving it a 4 star is because I order sautéd onions on my salad but it did not come out with my food.  I waited for about 5 mins to finally grab the waitress and told her.  She apologized and said she would get it.  I ate the salad and then she came back after another 5-10 min and said oh it never came out and indicated it was still coming.  I said no but I hope it's not on my check.  Well she assumed I didn't want it anymore and gave us our checks.  Not that big of a deal but not the best service.,2019-08-12 19:55:28

Let me say we read the reviews online, and were a little worried after we heard that it had been featured on Kitchen Nightmares with Gordan Ramsey.  We decided to go anyway, and regret it for sure.  My husband had the etouffee, and I had a steak with jambalaya and vegetables.  My husband also ordered the chargrilled oysters.  They arrived smothered with alfredo sauce, and were barely room temperature.  The bread was soggy and had to be eaten with a fork because it had so much sauce on it.  My steak was like leather, and was chewy.  The jambalaya tasted like it came out of a box mix i could buy at home.  The vegetables were limp, and tasted like they had been sitting in a warming tray for a while.  My husbands etouffee was quite a disappointment.   It was basically gumbo with a small portion of rice on top.  Definitely not the way we have had it in the past.  We paid $80 for this meal, and it wasn't worth it at all.

We think it is awesome fun to see if the changes he made stayed implemented or if the restaurant has gotten better or swerved downhill.

We were New Orleans back in October of 2014 and decided to take advantage of being close to Oceana, which was featured on Season 4 of Kitchen Nightmares.  Understandably, I was a bit put off, because this one was one of the worst episodes I recall watching with a disgusting kitchen, a rat problem (like many of the restaurants in the Quarter, being so close to the Gulf, it's a real issue) and of course, one of the first to make the notorious Brit throw his guts up.  It should have been a warning to us to stay the hell away.  However, when our key card to our hotel room at the Inn on St. Peters featured this restaurant on it, we said, what the hell...let's do it.

So glad we did.  The changes made to restaurants decor stayed exactly as they had been at the end of the show.  It was absolutely beautiful and clean.  Even the ladies room was immaculate.  

We ordered drinks.  My husband got a ""Greyhound"" and I had a Lemon Drop martini.  They were absolutely delicious, decently priced and served in large glasses.  For our appetizer, we ordered the Oyster's Rockerfeller and without a doubt, they were the BEST OR's I have ever eaten in my life.  So good in fact, that I ordered them again as my main course!  They are competitively priced based on the area and season at $10.50 for a half dozen and $17.50 for a dozen.  I don't know what the sauce was that was on it, but I could have had it in a bowl as a soup, it was that good.  My husband had the Praline Duck which he described as ""Delicious"" (as food was hanging from his mouth, mind you).  This was a slow simmered praline and rum sauce over the duck with a side of fresh steamed vegetables and roasted garlic potatoes.  

Also had a side of crawfish tails ($5.00) to pick on while waiting on the food.  The food wait time was scarcely 15 minutes.  Dessert for hubs was the bananas foster cake which smelled incredible.  I had a creme brulee that brought tears to my eyes, it was so fabulous. ($5.00 each)

The place was packed, but everyone looked happy and the place smelled fantastic.  There was a real sense of NOLA fun here, the wait staff was very attentive and super friendly.  The patrons were all talking with each other at various tables.  It was just a really fun atmosphere.  Yes, they were giving out cards for a YELP review and to mention your servers name, but it was for a sweepstakes for the STAFF...not a free drink for the customers ""bribing"" them for good reviews, so whoever wrote that is full of it.  So, thank you, Earl, for making us have a great experience.

Side note:  I am DEATHLY allergic to nuts. All kinds of nuts.  Walnuts, Pralines, Peanuts, Almonds, Cashews, etc.  The staff members all gathered around me, including the chef and managers to make sure they all talked about NO cross contamination, make my food away from other foods and a clean cutting board and using fresh utensils for cutting and carving.  One even mentioned that they have an EPI pen in their first aid kit in case I didn't have one.  I am always super impressed with a restaurant that knows how serious food allergies can be.  They took it very seriously and made me feel super comfortable.

So congrats, Chef Ramsey!  Oceana continues to be one of your best success stories in the French Quarter.

From the day we arrive on the planet and blinking step into the sun there is more to see than can ever be seen, more to do than can ever be done.

And I don't think I'm really trying to say that Oceana is necessarily ""taking advantage"" of tourists in any sort of devious way. More so that it's about on par with going to Florida on vacation and wanting seafood so you go to Bubba Gump. It's about in the Bubba Gump league.

I don't really have anything to come down on this place for other than its middle-of-the-road level of cuisine. Service wasn't bad. A few hiccups here and there but nothing where I felt they were doing a bad job or being lazy.

Comparing the crawfish etouffee to Royal House was pretty damning, as here the dish had plenty of seasoning and no real flavor, if that makes any sense.

Tried the blackened alligator here, as I wanted to eat as many different types of alligator as I could before I left. It was fine, tasted like chicken. And they do mean blackened by the way, it's not just lightly grilled.

My main entree was the fried seafood platter. Plenty of food, but I'm not really sure if I could say it was a worthy dish. It all tastes fine but towards the end you start to realize how much grease you must have consumed. Also those oysters, man, if you aren't big on oysters there is apparently little that can be done to salvage that.

It feels like a chain, even if it isn't a chain. It feels so branded that it sort of finishes any hopes at atmosphere and the food itself, regardless of how freshly made it is, suffers by giving a reflection of being processed.",2016-07-05 18:07:02

The gator bites for $10 was decent; I ordered them blackened served with remoulade sauce. The upside is that it was a pretty big portion for an appetizer.

Fried Shrimp Po-Boy for $14 was nothing special and their fries tasted like Checker's fries. The po-boy is topped with coleslaw, tomatoes, pickles, onions, and remoulade sauce.

Xa7_u-9xGgsC94v4OirabQ,UxRBIhm6gJj7P5JALT8MFw,ac1AeYqs8Z4_e2X5M3if2A,3,1,0,0,"I actually got food from Oceana Grill twice during my stay in New Orleans. The first time, I had a wonderful experience. The host was super friendly and our waiter Derek was absolutely a delight. One of the things I like about this place is the delicious vegetarian options. Being a vegetarian on a trip with friends who are not vegetarians, one of the things I hate doing is having the majority of my friends accomodate to my dietary habits. And of course, knowing Louisiana Creole Cuisine, almost everything contains either seafood or sausage. However, I was pleased to find that their vegetarian cajun stew was delicious. It didn't taste like it was missing anything, it was its own spin on a cajun dish that traditionally has meat in it!

I loved the cajun stew and also the fried eggplant sticks. That was one of the best vegetarian creole dishes I've had. However, the reason why I'm giving this place a 3 star is because of the second time.

Two nights after my first visit, I had already gone back to where I was staying (which was outside the French Quarters) and I did not have car. Since it was late at night, I didn't want to take public transportation or walk around. I decided to use Ubereats to order some food to satisfy some late night cravings. Not many places were open so I decided to just go with Oceana Grill again since I loved the food there so much. I wanted to try the vegetarian pasta there this time and so I put in my order. Once the delivery driver had delivered my meal, I checked the receipt and the food inside the apartment. The receipt clearly says vegetarian pasta"" but I received the cajun vegetarian stew in the box. This was no fault of the delivery driver since my receipt clearly indicated that it was rung up correctly. This was clearly a mistake on Oceana Grill's part. Although I was disappointed, I understand that mistakes happen so I called Oceana Grill about the mistake. I didn't expect them to redeliver since it was done through Ubereats, however, I honestly just wanted acknowledgment and a sincere apology for the mix up.

A host answered the phone and when I started talking about the mistake they made, he wanted to transfer me over to someone else. I said 'okay' and waited. I was transferred to speak to someone who is probably a manager and she cut me off again and said to put me on hold. I was put on hold until the phone line actually went out on me because I was waiting for too long. I called back after I was basically hung up on and the person on the other end listened to my complaint this time. HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO APOLOGY WHATSOEVER. I asked if the kitchen had mixed it up and if there is anyway to remedy this. He asked me where I lived and I told him the neighborhood. He replied and said that it was too far for them to deliver the food. Fine, then can I somehow get a discount for the next time I visit? ---I thought that to myself, expecting good customer service. He never apologized once. I had to actually tell him ""This is not the uber driver's fault right? It's a kitchen mix up since the receipt says pasta"" His exact words are ""yeah, our kitchen mixed it up."" No 'I'm sorry for the inconvenience' or 'This was a mistake and I do hope you come visit us again'. Nothing. He just said ""Yeah you're too far for us to deliver and it probably was the kitchen"". I asked if there's a way I can get my money back and he said ""Go ask Ubereats."" Still no apology. This is absolutely ridiculous. I actually stayed on the ine in silence waiting for just a ""I'm sorry"" and it never came. 

This was one of the worst customer service I've ever experienced from a restaurant. I had such a good experience the first time and I do admit the stew is delicious but I wanted a pasta pretty badly that night and there was no apology or attempts to remedy the problem. I had to initiate a remedy and still there was no apology or refund or fix. I did end up getting a refund from Ubereats but this isn't even ubereats's fault. This is entirely Oceana Grill's mistake. I don't care that I got the wrong dish, I do care that there was no sincerity and no apology in the mistake. 

Thank you Derek for a great first time visit and the food is absolutely wonderful. I understand that restaurants have mix ups but I do not tolerate bad customer service.",2018-03-13 01:10:25

The etouffé was perfectly seasoned, and for such a heavy dish, felt suprisingly light.  The po boys were the best we tried on our trip.  The combination of the fried oysters, crispy bread, and remoulade was delicious.  The service was also excellent and I liked the casual ambience.

The sauce is so heavy and over flavored that you can't taste the oysters. I've had this elsewhere in town and they are more simply done. Just a butter and fresh garlic finish. 
For my entree I had the taste of New Orleans. The red beans and rice/sausage was wonderful, as was the crawfish etouffee. The gumbo was very dry. The bread they served with it was stale and useless. 
My husband had a special that was a blackened redfish with a cornbread stuffing and some kind of sauce over it with shrimp on the top. It came with mustard greens. This was great. The fish was perfectly cooked and the stuffing tasted homemade. Not that dry stuffing you get at the grocery store. The mustard greens had a light dressing of olive oil and vinegar.

The service, specialty drinks, and food quality all good but intimate and upscale it isn't, yet they charge like it is. It feels more ""casual tourist trap eatery"" and less like a fine New Orleans authentic dining experience.

My girlfriend ordered the special - which was Red fish with some sort of topping. Hers was also cold and tasted horrible.

So I asked for a supervisor and my waiter went a got the supervisor Mike who was extremely RUDE and told me there wasn't anything that he can do. I then asked Mike, if this would have happened to your wife, grandmother , sister or daughter, would you be okay with this? Mike replied, my people would not complain like you people. So at that time I asked for Mike's boss who was Daniel Caesar,and I explained what happened and Daniel said that he could not make my bill any less , this is a private own establishment and to accommodate me he will need to pay out of pocket.

For my meal, I started off with a half dozen of Oceana's famous oysters. The oysters were great, the sauce was wonderful. 

Then, I ordered the special blackened redfish with fried crawfish on top of jalapeño stuffing. Don't fret over the jalapeño in the stuffing, it added a great flavor. The fish was amazing, I enjoyed every last bite of it and wanted more even though I had to unbutton my pants I was so stuffed. 

My date ordered the crab cake appetizer, as you can see it came with two cakes that were a generous size. The crawfish sauce on top made the dish, it was an explosion on my taste buds that had me crawling back for more. 

Overall, Oceana is an easy 5 star restaurant that is a must visit in this wonderful town we call Nola. I will be back, this place is absolutely mouth watering. And shoutout to Mary once again",2019-01-13 02:29:59

I remember walking in, it was a bit crowded. There was a wait to be seated in the dining area, so of course... forget the wait, and let's sit at the crowded bar! We told the bartender that we were going to eat and drink, so he sat us down instantly.

We ordered the Oyster Rockefeller, the Fried Seafood Platter, and the Seafood Jambalaya. And of course beer.

The Oyster Rockefeller was probably the first cooked oysters I ate for the week. It was cooked with Spinach, Bacon, in Perdon Liqueur, and was topped with Parmesan Cheese. Yes, I was a bit oystered out already... But it was still good. Truthfully, these oysters were cooked... And I'm not really into cooked oysters, and secondly... It's too rich for my appetite. It really made me feel bloated, and we weren't able to finish the dozen. 

The Fried Seafood Platter was just okay. It really wasn't a big deal. Nothing extraordinary either. I could probably order the same stuff anywhere. Yes, a bit on the greasy side and too rich for me. Couldn't finish this order either.

And third, the Seafood Jambalaya was delicious! It looked pretty bland when it was brought over. Very flavorful, and also a bit too heavy with all the Jambalaya ingredients mixed. But don't get me wrong about this dish. I liked it.

I think all the things ordered was decent. Maybe we should have ordered something lighter to help digest easier, or just order two out of the three and beer.

This was actually the first time I was so thankful to drink beer. And lots of it too. Their catch is to prepare the food very hefty... So you'll order more beer. Lol.

Oceana is a small place. It was very crowded when we got there. Everybody was quite friendly, including the patrons sitting around the bar. I was able to chit chat with three different people at the bar. One guy was probably either drunk, or ran out of things to talk about with his date, so he started talking to me about my food, another guy sat next to me after and started talking to me about sports and health & well-being, while a third was a gal from Texas, who stood next to me and asked where I was from. Interesting conversations... I thought it was cool!

Also when I'm at a restaurant I expect and love to TIP very well based on my waiter or waitress being nice to us... The four of us ordered waters because we really don't drink sodas or anything like that and we didn't even ever get refills on water??? We didn't even get a-""how's everything going"" 
Anyways Daniel L our server was just DDDDRRRYYY
Now...I'm not saying he was a mean or rude..I'm just saying thr wasn't much emotion in his being? Not even a ""how are u guys doing tonight ""???
So I'm thinking our visit to the south...our waiter would introduce some Southern hospitality our way?? -NOPE
We could've went to Applebee's???
I think this is just a person who is working a side gig while they're in school or something??? 
I ordered the blackened catfish and about 2 mins after I asked Daniel if I could gt the fried catfish?
Daniel stated ""Thr already making it"" so it was a no go in NOLA...
The blackened catfish came with jambalaya rice and vegetables @ since I can't eat shellfish I asked my server if I can get something different and he said garlic mashed potatoes and that was it?...there were not many choices stated...
Anyways my food came out and the catfish was this little strip piece of fish??? Nothing special... also in the plate was this side dish that looked like some kind of cooked spinach along w/ jambalaya rice which I thought I told the waiter I couldn't eat shellfish? So being pretty annoyed I just told him that I didn't want it!! 
I ordered the chicken Alfredo instead and it was way better and I hate to say it but I didn't tip...I mean he didn't even do anything?? he didn't even bring the food out??someone else brought out the food..
So the one star is just for service and the restaurant itself was very nice....

I saw an ad for it in the airport while I was waiting for my luggage, which I took as a red flag of ""tourist trap"", but decided to go anyway for dinner for the first night in town.

We made a reservation online. On arrival, the two hostesses appeared to be arguing with each other at the front stand. We stood there awkwardly for a minute until they finally acknowledged us, then shrugged us towards the staircase. We were greeted by another friendlier hostess at the top of the staircase, who showed us to our table. 

We ordered appetizers of BBQ Shrimp & Crab Cakes- these were definitely the highlights of the meal. I particularly loved the sauce the shrimp came in. I also really enjoyed the crab cakes (not going to lie, they were the biggest reason I wanted to try this place when I was looking through the menu). Good size, crab tasted fresh, perfectly crispy outside... but I was expecting more flavor from the sauce they were topped with.

Entrees were the miss of the evening. I went for their ""signature dish"", the Redfish Oceana. The fish by itself had no taste- bland is an understatement. It was a little better with the sauce, but again, I expected more flavor from a signature dish. We also ordered the Cajun Jambalaya pasta, which was better than the Redfish Oceana but still nothing to write home about.

I am not going to talk too much about the food. We ordered the cajun fries, NO favorites, redfish and bread pudding.  They were tasty.

The real kicker of the story here started when we got done ordering our food.  I felt something smack against the side of my face. When I reached for it, I felt it move down onto the table.  We then realized that there was a 3 inch long roach right there on our table crawling around. I jumped out of my seat right away because I am absolutely terrified of roaches. A few moments later, the staff came by, and ""took care of it"".  We changed table but I was so traumatized that the rest of the dinner was less than enjoyable.  

Our young waiter came and was somewhat apologetic about it.  He even told me about a time a roach jumped down his shirt. Thanks for that mental image...not. We ate our dinner and then came the bill.  I was so surprised to see our bill charged as full, given to us without another word of apology. No, no, no.. I asked to speak with the manager, and came a gentleman wearing a red tie.  I explained the incident to him calmly, and he explained that the restaurant passed all health checks and that they have no control over the court yard where the roaches can come from.  Um... did he just try to justify this?  I pressed on and said how is a roach landing on your customer INSIDE the restaurant an expected outcome of dining here? And then he got defensive and said that roaches can fly wherever they want and there isn't anything he can do.  I was furious at that point. Not because a roach landed on me, but because this manager thought my poor dining experience in his restaurant was not his problem.  A few more rounds back and forth, he suggested a 10% discount and free dessert.  I didn't think he was going to be more sympathetic than that so we paid the bill and left with a bitter taste in our mouths.  With so many good places nearby, I cannot recommend anyone to dine here if you care about good dining experience. YIKES.",2018-11-11 07:10:45

Beer: draft Ragin Cajun. Sweet and crisp yellow-gold ale.

Appetizer: Crab cake was seasoned nicely but was a bit dry. Probably overcooked a bit. Alligator sausage was a gamy sausage with a much stronger taste than regular sausages, but it was delicious.

Entree: I had the red fish with mash potatoes and had an extra crawfish side.  Red fish was cooked nice, the sauce pleasant but not overwhelming. Crawfish side tasted standard. My friend's blackened duck was delicious. Duck skin crispy and duck fat half-melted, the aroma was irresistible. 

Dessert: ice cream cake. Huge portion and a good end note for the meal. 

Service: I did have to remind the waiter for my beer, but overall it was friendly and attentive. 

This is a great place. With some improvements it could easily be five star. Also we find the seasoning and sauces in this place quite balanced, not overwhelmingly salty. Might be a good slight deviation from the typical Cajun/Creole cuisine.",2020-01-17 04:08:29

With a great mixture of spices and culture, Cajun food is a culinary delight, and I tried my best to eat it at every meal.

Oceana Grill was the choice for our Friday night dinner because of its ability to support a large party of 12, and it turned out to be a great choice. This party was a surprise party for my friend Josh, and the restaurant was very accommodating.

I started with the barbecued shrimp appetizer which was very well spiced, not too hot, but very flavorful. I was a little disappointed that the shrimp was not already peeled, but that did not become too difficult for me to work through. After a delicious appetizer, I chose to go with the taste of New Orleans, which contains Creole jambalaya, crawfish etouffée, red beans and rice with smoked sausage. What a mixture!! Every bit of it was worth every bite, but in particular, the jambalaya was some of the best I have ever tasted.

Our new friend Keith over at Johnny White's (hole in the wall) recommended it and we're glad he did.

Not only was the food good (following) but the service was FRIENDLY, fast and attentive.  Lacy was just awesome and obviously works her tush off!  Thank you, Lacy!

Food:  I enjoyed the Ribeye Steak (die-hard red meat fan here) with Shrimp sauce.  Good cut of steak; not great, but good and nicely flavored and well prepared.  Wife had the blackened Aji Tuna which was just off the charts in terms of outright delicious, intense pan-seared flavors; sweet, salt and spice all in one!  My bro had the Crawfish Etouffe which was truly delicious with a mouthful of crawfish in that wonderful sauce!  My sis enjoyed the seafood pasta (Fettucini?) special that was overwhelmed with shrimp, crawfish, red-fish, mussels and clams in a well-balanced cream sauce.  Yum!

Dessert was Pecan Pie; nice, not ""oh my God"" great, but satisfying (note: PLEASE start keeping some 'Nilla ice cream on hand!)  The Chocolate Mousse was closer to gustatory orgasm, however and is well recommended!

Dinner for four WITH drinks AND dessert and with no reservations came to about $40 per person with tip.  In my book that is reasonable for the friendly service and good food!

Also, they're the only place we found in the 1/4 with XRated Vodka; a nice plus!  Cheers!

I had the Louisiana Crabmeat Cake served with crawfish, mushroom and cream sauce. It was nothing like it was last year. We didn't finish eating that. Next I ordered Fried Shrimp, mashed potatoes, coleslaw, and Hushpuppies. Those were the worst Fried Shrimp and Hushpuppies I'd ever had. There was way too much breading on the Shrimp.  Even when I pulled off the breading, the shrimp were like rubber. The shrimp and Hushpuppies also tasted like they had been fried in OLD grease. 

I complained to our waiter and he immediately grabbed my plate and brought out the chef. They were both apologetic, and he wanted to fix me another order. It only took him a few minutes and the chef brought me out a new plate piled high with shrimp. Unfortunately they tasted the same. Apparently these are not fresh shrimp, but frozen. The breading was the same and the grease tastes the same. Hard to believe I'm sitting in a restaurant on the Gulf and get frozen shrimp. 

I'm glad the chef and waiter offered to help and both went out of their way to accommodate me. But there was no fixing those yucky, frozen , over breaded shrimp.

I am a Yelp-a-holic, so I spent a significant amount of time looking for an affordable, high rated seafood restaurant for my boyfriend and I to go to during our trip to NOLA.  Oceana Grill had consistently good reviews so we decided to give it a try. Disclaimer, my boyfriend and I are a bit of foodies, as we lived in Chicago and experienced some truly amazing food.  However, the food at Oceana did not meet our expectations considering their high reviews.

I do want to mention again, the oysters were excellent. I would definitely go back for the oysters because they were fresh, large, and very affordable. If you are looking for a good oyster bar, this is your place. For the main course, I ordered the Redfish Oceana since it was listed as a specialty dish and my boyfriend ordered the Shrimp Creole. We shared our dishes. The red fish was overcooked and since it had a little bit of a breading, it was dry. The sauce with the crayfish on top was good, but did not have a ton of flavor. It tasted kind of like gravy. If the dish was $10-12 I would have been satisfied, but the red fish was $20.  I expect much more out of a $20 dish. The Shrimp Creole straight up tasted like shrimp in Speghettio sauce. Seriously, it brought me back to my youth but not in a good way.  It had no real ""cajun flavor"".  The previous day we had eaten a similar dish at The World Famous N'Awlins Cafe in the French Market and it was light years better at half the price.

I got started with the charbroiled oysters which had just the right flavor and charbroiled taste to complete the flavors.  The oysters come in a cream sauce and they are pretty big.

The first time I went, my main course was a scrumptious fish dish, and tonight I switched gears to a steak dinner with a side of Jambalaya and a sauteed veggies.  Good steak and even better Jambalaya!  Even the veggies knocked my socks off.

The one thing that kind of concerned me was it took a while for the hostess to seat the group in front of me, but it wasn't a deal breaker at all.  The location (right off Bourbon Street) is great for entertaining folks from out of town, so I say it's a winner.",2011-05-19 04:12:34

Went on a Monday evening, fairly early, so only had about a 15 minute wait. I suspect they try to keep a line outside to generate interest from passerbys as there were plenty of open tables when we were seated upstairs in this surprisingly large and laid back place. 

First note - service was OUTSTANDING from start to finish! May have the best ever in my experience. Attentive, timely, but not intrusive. 

Our smallish group went with several plates of the blackened redfish etouffee, a steak (ordered well done despite screams of protest by other members of the group!), and my crab cake pasta. 

Appetizer plates shared of gator bites, both black and gold, and alligator sausage. The bites were okay (slightly chewy taste like chicken), but the sausage was really good and a generous portion.

I was initially going with the same redfish selection but after asking was confirmed that it is a bit heavy on green peppers (anathema!). The etouffee I sampled was outrageously good and had a big kick to it as well. The crab cake was very well balanced in flavor with the crab forefront and not overwhelmed at all with onion (an issue I often find with crab cakes).

Also ordered a category 5 hurricane which was delivered strong, but a little lacking in volume as it ran out much too quickly!  

Had a fantastic time at a surprisingly affordable cost.",2014-05-02 15:32:44

We were greeted and seated promptly and then it went downhill from there.  The waiter came quicly (which I normally like) but we hadn't even decided on drinks yet so we hastly ordered some drinks and an appetizer of the alligator bites.  The drinks took about 10 minutes to arrive and the waiter took our order.  The alligator bites arrived soon after an they were ""meh"" - a little overcooked so that they were chewey but they weren't that bad.  And then we waited.  And waited.  And waited for our entrees.  About 40 minutes later our food arrived.  Mind you, this was a party of 2 so it's not like we had a lot of food.  I had the crawfish etoufee which had a slight flim on top since it'd been in a warming window for a while.  But once I got past that, it was good.  My companion had some sort of shrimp pasta.  I think they should've called the dish garlic in pasta with a few shrimp thrown in.  WOW... was it ever garlicy!  It burned to eat so that my friend couldn't stand more than a few bites.  I shared my etoufee.
And the waiter?  Didn't see him until he came by and dropped off the check.  No offers to get us more drinks, no checking in to see if we enjoyed our dinner.  Then again, he was wrapped up in a 6 top next to us, chatting with them about how much he loves Chicago (where those guests where from?).

I was looking for close to Heaven on 7 gumbo like back home in Chicago. And finally I found it even better. I wish I could have taken some of this back home it was so good. It was Thursday at 1pm and single I opted for bar. The bartender was wonderful she was very attentive and helped recommend great features of the restaurant. I decided to order the cup of seafood gumbo and half fried oysters/half fried shrimp poor boy w a side of jalapeño hush puppies!!! 
The gumbo was thick roux with good helping of veggies and seafood. And nice scoop of rice but not to much and I liked the claw served on top. It was very mild not to spicy and a perfect portion for lunch w a sandwich.
The poor boy arrived w a side of fries instead of hush puppies and the bartender immediately had it replaced with the correct within a minute. The poor boy was delicious never having fried oysters these were a treat and the shrimp both had a great salty crisp batter. The sauce was perfect to the seafood, the bread was soft and toppings fresh. I could only finish half the bread but finished all my seafood bc it was so tasty could not pass. The french fries were french fries I would definitely trade out for hush puppies or something else they are known for. I finished every hush puppy they were delicious. 

The restaurant manager stop by to introduce himself and inquired about my visit and how I was enjoying my stay in New Orleans. I observed how he spoke to his staff and other customers very attentive and helpful great management skills and observed the staff respectful and helpful.

We started with the chargrilled oysters. I am not a huge oyster fan, but these were AMAZING. Why are oysters so little?!? BULLSHIT. These were.. amazing. I miss them already. Delicious tomatoey, cheesy, oystery goodness.. reasonably priced and just perfect.

For my entree, I ordered the blackened Redfish etoufee. The fish was average. As a pescitarian, cajun food is hard. There is chicken stock in... everything. I don't mind- I'll eat the plain stuff, but my boyfriend did ask the waitress if the etoufee had chicken stock, and she said no. I don't believe her- it tasted... weird. Maybe it just had a weird flavor. .In any case, it was just alright. The side of greens, I hardly touched.

My boyfriend ordered a sampler of etoufee, jambalaya, red beans and rice, and sausage. He was also very neutral about his dish but ADORED the andouille sausage.

The first time we came here, I wasn't expecting too much only because it was a Kitchen Nightmare restaurant. How much better could it be than what they showed on TV?

I ordered the blackened catfish and it was melt in your mouth delicious. The roasted vegetables on the side were in a little sauce cup. Not impressive at all. I also asked for a side of rice and literally it's about 1/4 cup of rice for $3?! No thank you!

We only wanted oysters and something else small. The waitress gave us attitude for just ordering apps. Oysters this time around were big and plump, but they tasted like they were soaked in water.

On my final day in New Orleans, I decided to find a place to go have lunch close to the hotel, and found this little place off Bourbon street - OCEANA GRILL.  A guy in front of the establishment was calling out to people to try the place since it was so good, and had a menu in his hand.  I took his word, and walked inside....

It's a smaller place, and would call it kind of a dive, by appearance alone.

My friend and I were greeted by our server, Aaron S.  We both ordered the crab cake burgers, and ditched the side order of french fries that come with the burger (since we can get fries anywhere) - so my friend ordered the side of jambalaya, and I ordered the side of crawfish etouffee (and we'd share).

For drinks, we both ordered hurricanes - made not with a pre-mix - but with real fruit juices.

Aaron S. was a SPECTACULAR and FRIENDLY server.  He was enthusiastic, and was not overbearing at all.  In fact, the table next to us was even raving about him TO THE MANAGER - saying that he was the friendliest server they have encountered on their trip.  The same goes for us!  BRAVO, Aaron S.

The crab cake burgers were excellent and tasty, and worth every penny.  The jambalaya was tasty , tangy, and well blended with spices.  The crawfish etouffee had a good amount of crawfish for being a side...

My friend ordered a sazerac for a 2nd drink and enjoyed it at this establishment.  I ordered an abita draft - and you can't ever go wrong with that  ;)

Altogether, the experience was enjoyable and memorable - highlighted by the great service Aaron S. gave us.  When I go back to New Orleans next year, I will surely return...",2008-07-26 17:06:39

We started with appetizers of alligator tail, soft shell crab and crawfish etouffee.

He had the fried catfish platter and I ordered the seafood sampler with the addition of the crawfish tails. I loved it.

Fried oysters are apparently not my thing. The fries were tasty and there were jalapeno hushpuppies but I never got around to them, too much food on the plate! He ordered the Bananas Foster Ice Cream Cake and I had the Chocolate Kahlua Mousse cake. Amazing. Just yummy.

Visited Oceana Grill while in NOLA for Essence Fest.  The restaurant is huge and they can accommodate small or large parties.  Great service.  

But the food...I had crawfish etouffee and it was not worth ordering as it tasted like it came from a box mix...the fried shrimp was just ok...the food at the Sheraton was better...

I also ate at Dookey Chase the day before and the bar was set pretty high.

Conclusion - it' ok.  But there are places with better food in the area...",2019-07-07 15:59:57

The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because we had to wait outside for over an hour in line to get seated. However, it was nice that some of the waitstaff came out and provided water to people waiting for seats. 

I ordered Oceana's Famous Oysters--they were the best I've ever had, and a Blackened Chicken Po'boy--equally as delicious as my app. My friend ordered the Crab Cake meal and while it was good, it wasn't great. Our waiter was courteous and attentive and the food came out fast.

The red beans with sausage was fantastic the etoufee was amazing and the jambalaya was terrific! For dessert we had Bourbon pecan pie warmed with a scoop of ice cream it was delicious!

Everything about it was amazing. Our server first recommended the crab cakes.  They are the best any of us have ever had. (you know if cops come in and order them that they must be good). I had one of the chef's specials for the night, Mardi Gras Pasta, fetuccini topped with crab, crawfish, shrimp and a crawfish cream sauce.  It was delicious!  We also had oysters on the half shell, shrimp fetuccini, chicken fetuccini, jambalaya pasta and the roasted duck. Everything was great. Whoever is making the sauces in the back needs a raise!

Our waiter was great. Making sure we had anything we needed. Finally it was time for dessert,  we decided on the bread pudding and the bananas foster (both reccomended by our waiter).  They were amazing!  This was an overall great experience. 

After a bad experience at lunch the next day, we decided to go back for dinner again. Of course we ordered the crab cakes again.  And they were delicious, again.  We all ordered something different and it was all amazing.  I had the surf and turf special. Blackened ribeye with the crawfish sauce, jambalaya and fried shrimp.  The steak was amazing. Better than some filets that I've had and I live in Texas.  They couldve served just the steak on a plate and I would've been happy. But the shrimp just melts in your mouth. It was breaded and cooked perfectly. We also tried the stuffed tuna, fried shrimp platter and redfish.  Again, everything was delicious.

Really hits the spot when you're in the mood for cajun pasta.  Their service is great - very friendly staff.  However, I've had 2 incidents, nothing major - but it makes me give it 3 instead of 5 stars. Our first trip the waitress messed up our bill and didn't charge us enough for our total bill.  We happened to stay there at the table chatting long after we paid so she was able to find us and asked me to sign a new bill with a higher amount. Fine. While we were figuring out our bill they came & took our plates without asking us if we wanted to take the leftovers to go.  We had already planned to eat the leftovers for lunch the next day. Oh well - our fault too, we should've remembered to ask for a box. But the waitress said that because the error in the bill was HER error, she'd have the bar take off our drinks and I'd see the credit on my credit card.  That never happened.

We went back again on our 2nd trip to NOLA a few months later with some friends. Evening was fine - had my cajun pasta again & loved it.

 Our 3rd trip we made a reservation months in advance for a party of 50! We were coming down for our wedding and as a nervous bride I called twice to confirm my reservations 2 weeks before our wedding.  However, the night we arrive to Oceana Grill -- ALL 45 of us!!! -- They do NOT have my reservation on their books. I was shocked. But - the manager quickly got his staff on the ball and within 15 minutes we had one room all set up for our party. The evening was a huge success - and everyone loved the food!!!

We'll go back again I'm sure.  Mistakes happen so I don't hold a grudge - my biggest disappointment was the 1st waitress who never credited our drink bill as promised. I really wanted to give it 5 stars - but these little incidents each time add up.",2014-04-15 08:14:07

We went for brunch and were blown away with the shrimp etoufee; it was a genuine taste that resonated throughout the theme of cajun food the rest of our trip. 

WHITNEY is the best waitress! She was so nice and recommended the best food & also found out that we were visitors and gave us a brochure as well as her fave spots to make the best of our vacation. She gave an absolute 5/5 customer service.

With such a great experience with food and service, we decided to come back and enjoyed the dishes pictured below. Every one was sooooo good; BBQ shrimp had a thick flavorful sauce that was complemented so well with the bread. The soft shell crab and chargrilled oysters were to die for!!

I had the gator bites and a fried oyster po boy. 

The gator bites were a bit on the salty side and tasted like chicken (of course, aside from the extra chewiness in texture that alligator meat gives). It had been fried and coated in sauce. Pretty similar to your average chicken poppers, but with alligator. 

The fried oyster po boy had a decent amount of fried oysters in there and I did enjoy that part. However, the bread was pretty plain and it was just there. Didn't really add anything to it. I wish I had just the fried oysters by themselves. 

It's a pretty no frills place. The interior is quite dark. The seats aren't the most comfortable. But it does seem to have a lot of history, and they even sell their own t-shirts.",2018-01-10 16:26:10

I was pulled in by the yelp pics of the mardi gras pasta and delicious looking crab cakes. Who doesn't love a great crab cake?!  So on my first day visiting I had 8pm reservations scheduled and I was EXCITED! We were seated promptly and I was ready for a great meal! I ordered both the mardi gras pasta and the crab cake appetizer and two desserts. 

The crab cakes weren't at all what I was expecting. I was hoping for it to be full of lump crab meat drenched in a delicious creamy sauce and I didn't really get either. The sauce was just ok, the mushrooms in it were great, but the crab cakes themselves were not good at all. Tasted like filler and not much crab. I tried opening it up to get to the crab meat but unfortunately there wasn't much to get to. I didn't even come close to finishing it because the taste just wasn't there. This was a huge disappointment but I still held out hope for the mardi gras pasta!

The entrees came out very fast, like under 10 minutes, which in this case should've been a red flag. The mardi gras pasta was edible but not at all enjoyable. It tasted like it was missing something...I rarely add seasoning to my food in restaurants but for this one I added salt just to get some type of flavor going. The sauce was very thin and didn't really stick to the noodles and the seafood in it didn't have that fresh taste that I was hoping for. The pasta tasted reheated by microwave. 

By this point I was completely disheartened because everything I had been looking forward to try was substandard. Being a glutton for punishment (and still very hungry) we decided to give their world's famous bread pudding  and creme brulee a try. Sigh, I'm sure at this point I don't have to tell you how that went. The creme brulee tasted oddly like sweet potato pie and was very cold. The bread pudding was nothing special though I did enjoy the caramel drizzle that they added. That drizzle was the highlight of my entire meal unfortunately. 

Overall this was a huge disappointment. I hope maybe it was an off night but I doubt it was.",2017-08-29 19:31:21

We spent about 5 days in the french quarter and without fail, at any time of day this place had a line of people going down the sidewalk a good block, just waiting to get in. We figured the throng of waiting diners and positive online reviews meant that this place would be pretty good, but this place was just so underwhelming. The food was not bad per se, but it wasn't really good either. We weren't expecting anything mind-blowing or fancy at this price point, but it really felt like I had walked into a tourist trap with menu offerings akin to an Applebees with a Creole twist. If you've got picky kids who won't eat anything remotely 'colorful' or fellow diners with a really limited palette, I would say that this place is just fine, but as you're not hard pressed to find good food in the New Orleans I might suggest you try somewhere else first.",2019-05-28 20:14:08

Crab Cakes
Gumbo
Seafood Platter
Crawfish Etoufee'

INSANE?!  Yes.  Delicious yes!

Crab Cakes are amazingly round and thick and moist and delish.  Covered in a...wait for it...wait for it....Crawfish and Mushroom cream sauce.  OMG.  Someone just pour the cream sauce down my darn throat!

Gumbo - very tasty.  The only thing I had an issue with was the crab shells.  But yes - I ate the entire cup.

Seafood Platter - Catfish and Shrimp (I don't eat oysters) were deliciously battered and fried to perfection.

Crawfish Etoufee - now I am not the one who ordered this but the friend that did raved for hours about the darned stuff.  It looked yummy.

Service - AMAZING fast service!  It was awesome.  We could barely finish one dish before the other arrived.  Staff was courteous and helpful when it came to decision making.

Drinks - if you order a drink that you give specific direction on : Kettle 1 with pineapple and light ice - it comes out great.  If you order one of theirs - they're not that strong - but tasty like juice.

Overall - amazing and I will go back time and time again.  Oh wait - yes - We went back two days later.....",2013-07-10 20:20:03

The food was kind of pricey but well worth it. The portions were huge and the food was tasty. Everyone in my group was happy with the food they selected.

I got the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, I was sad because I was not able to finish it all (although I was tempted). Creamy, cajun goodness with shrimp and alligator sausage.

ubsjwTdCufD-qDHaj8GftA,Anam0Ck1ZsFrA6FhVP-JEg,ac1AeYqs8Z4_e2X5M3if2A,5,27,17,20,"Epic little place that we found while meandering the streets of the French Quarter. Have walked by dozens of times but never even noticed the place! Somewhat hidden and unassuming venue off of Bourbon street on Conti St.

There is a really large area upstairs that can accommodate larger groups, which is near where we were seated. Downstairs has a few tables and a decent sized bar area.

I started off with a bang via double Absolute and Red Bull. Yippee-Yi-Yo-Ti-Yay!!! Great start and at $14.50 for a double, fairly reasonable. Next came the BBQ peel and eat Shrimp appetizer for $8.00. Another great deal considering the size and amount of shrimp, as well as the overall flavor. Saturated in a tangy, savory sauce, they were everything I expected and more, (including the mess). I typically am not a big fan of peel and eat shrimp, (mainly because of the messiness), but these were well worth the effort. Served up with a couple slices of soft, fresh and warm sourdough bread. Perfect for dipping into the leftover BBQ sauce!!!

Followed that up with a ""Taste of New Orleans"" entrée, priced at $16.00 Excellent value there... The etouffee' was killer good, jambalaya was deliciously piquant, sausage appropriately spicey, (it really brought the taste buds to life), and the red beans / rice were out of this world.

Service, while a tad on the slow side, was extremely hospitable. The tempo of the service didn't really bother us though, as we were in no real hurry to leave. Definitely worth a repeat visit when I go back in May!!!",2016-12-01 18:53:33

The only dish we thought that was decent was the crabmeat cakes, which was smothered with a creamy mushroom sauce. This was moist and flavorful! 

The rest of our items were just meh. We asked which is the best po' boy here, and our server replied with the shrimp po' boy. The bread itself was too crispy and hard for our liking... it didn't fit comfortably in our mouths and we felt like we would have ended with a cut in our mouths or something! Haha... we ended up ripping a lot of the bread out and putting them to the side. Other than that hassle, po' boy was fine. Definitely skip on the oysters!! We tried both raw and chargrilled. Raw oysters had sand and even pieces of shell in the oysters.. I even had to pick a tiny piece of severed shell that was piercing one of the oysters (see pic!). Not sure how they missed that before serving it out?? The chargrilled one had decent flavor, but it was quite chewy! Both didn't taste very fresh either. 

I will say this place is located in a convenient location, right off of hectic Bourbon street meanwhile still being in the French Quarter. If you dine here, I say stick with the crabmeat cakes and avoid the oysters!",2016-05-22 00:38:13

At 4:05 the bartender said are you sure you made reservations.  My name was on reservation board another hostess then came over and said you can't make same day reservations. And i stated my name is on the board and she said no it's not and i said I'm pretty sure i saw it but maybe I'm wrong. A second hostess then said the reservation was made and was valid.   During this time multiple parties without reservations had been seated.  We were upstairs in a room with 10 tables and three occupied.  The fried alligator appetizer was good the two full pieces we got otherwise the pieces were the crumbs in the bottom of the basket.  We shared the seafood platter the hush puppies were not fully cooked in the middle.  The catfish and shrimp was good.  Would not go back due to the rude service and exceptionally high prices for the portions we received.

My girlfriend had the Taste of New Orleans sampler platter and was equally food-struck (and equally as intoxicated). Our compliments to the chef all around.

Crab cakes are apparently their specialty. Ours came out lukewarm and they were fine but definitely not worth $16 for two wimpy hockey pucks.

I got the blackened redfish and the actual fish portion was very large, so I was happy about that. And the fish was very good. The sides though, were very tiny and disproportionate. And it felt like the whole meal had been prepared before and just heated up along the way. You know that feeling when you see food come out and you're like...""that was in a freezer recently.""

The staff here is top-notch. Everyone we came in contact with was cheerful and welcoming. The bar made some very good drinks for a number of people in our party. Our waiter took the rest of our drink and appetizer orders and was able to answer all of our questions about the menu.

We ordered a wide variety of food and everything was absolutely amazing! The gator tail bites were very tender and flavorful with a sauce that had a bit of kick to it. The cajun fries had a delicious sauce that was like nothing we had tasted before Their gumbo was rich and savory. BBQ ribs were some of the best were ever had in a restaurant.

We're not from NOLA and wanted to eat some local grub for dinner but hadn't done our research. We were hungry and the place was full-- that is USUALLY a good sign.

We walked in and the moment we did, we sort of knew we'd be getting less than we paid for.

I'll start with the food because that's what's important. It was fine. Nothing amazing and obviously sitting in big vats in the back. From the moment our order was placed to out on our table, it was about 7 minutes. It tasted like it was just slopped on the plate. Everything looked the same and it wasn't overly impressive. I added about 10 drops of hot sauce and it barely put a dent in making it spiced/flavorful.

My husband had the Taste of NOLA or whatever it was called, and I had a veggie meal with a bunch of seasonal veggies (of which the waiter told me included peppers of all kinds and there wasn't a single one in the mix) and two slices of bread with 1/2 cup of cheap rice for $13. Serious ripoff.

He couldn't finish his dish because it was huge, but per him, it was amazing. It looked loaded with the gravy & already came with crawfish tails in the gravy. He loved it. I know this because he didn't even touch the side of ranch, and my man is a ranch man. I didn't know they had the stew so I was pleasantly surprised when I saw it as a choice and when I ate my first bite. So much flavor!- a great balance of savory & some tang. And the bread was nice and soft.",2019-10-11 17:21:57

We were in town for one night. After walking through the French quarter Oceana was recommended by a couple NOPD officers when I asked for good authentic seafood that wouldn't break the bank.

We knew it was good when there was a line. However we didn't wait any longer than 20 mins. They escorted us in to the third floor and this place is so cool on the inside. Rustic but the smells coming from the kitchen were awesome and inviting.

Our waiter ( Mike - an aspiring actor from Michigan ) quickly got to our table and took our drink order. He was top notch. Very friendly and helpful. We started with the gumbo as an appetizer. It was my fiancé and 16 year old son. So having a teenager can be a challenge when you want to try something new. The gumbo was amazing! My son said the best he's ever had.

I had the red fish special with collard greens and a crawfish sauce on top. My son had the crab cakes with collard greens and mashed potatoes. My fiancé had The Taste of New Orleans.

All 5 of us had a seafood dish or a steak and it was absolutely served fresh, hot and it all really tasted light and excellently seasoned. No one had anything that wasn't delicious and there is a ton of food at really great prices.

The best thing was our server Mary who was professional, upbeat, positive and polite with great suggestions and she explained all of our questions very clearly.

We had a full hour to spend, which in my experience is sufficient for lunch. We waited about 5 minutes and were seated. We already ordered our drinks from the bar and all kinda knew what we wanted so we were quickly ready to order. I ordered the famous oysters and a cup of gumbo. The oysters were NOT good. I am thinking they are famous for being yucky. They tasted like they were smothered in thousand island dressing. My gumbo wasn't very yummy either. The shrimp were almost mushy. No texture at all. The flavor of the gumbo was ok, but the little shrimp were off putting. My hubby had the catfish platter. That was really good and the main reason this is a 2 star review and not 1 star. 
We were finished for a while and finally had to find our server and ask for our check. You'd think that napkins in plates and empty drinks would be a sign we were finished, but guess not. It then took her another 15 minutes to take care of settling our bill which almost made us late for our tour.

Granted, I don't eat a whole lot of the stuff because, well, for one, it will kill you, but moreso because you just won't find a dish like this up north. (Save for maybe Pies & Thighs in Brooklyn.)

This was my second trip to NOLA in two years, and both times I had to go to Oceana for this dish and for a few of their equally excellent Bloody Mary's. It is absolutely worth the extra 10 or 20 miles I need to pound out afterward, because it is simply THAT good. Did I mention that it's good?

I've seen other dishes emerge from the kitchen, and they all look very basic and blah. The only dish I have ever seen anyone rave about are the absolutely, positively, totally, and fully awesome sausage biscuits and gravy. This is the dish you order when you come here. And frankly, this is the only reason you even consider coming here.

My advise to you, just order 1/2 dozen or 1 dozen max.  Then order again 1/2, 1/2, and 1/2 again seperately.   Otherwise your oyster would be smallest among the customers.   We will spend more money and will get less quality foods.",2019-12-15 23:45:58

We were shocked to find a line down the street waiting to get in, you know, like those popular bars in LA or NY City. We contemplated finding some where else to eat but decided to wait it out. Surprisingly enough the wait wasn't that long, maybe 20 minutes. They have a outside hostess that snags the people who try to go in, by passing the line(purly innocently, I am sure) and getting the numbers in each party. She then passes that information along to the indoor hostess who then tells her how many to send it at a time. They do take reservations, so I would suggest making one before going. 

Once we were seated, on the 3rd floor, we studied the menu. They had a variety of appetizers and plenty of entrees to choose from. We order the blackened alligator bites for our appetizer. The flavor was wonderful, but I think ai prefer the fried. I don't feel like the blackened was tenderized enough; I had picked up a larger piece and felt like I had to chew forever to get it down! Hubby lived it, though. For our main entree, my husband chose the Shrimp Alfredo, which was served in a heaping portion with steam rising from it and crusty bread on the side. I went for the Taste of New Orleans sampler plate. It came with 3 cups, one of each, crawfish etouffèe, jambalaya and red beans and rice with a slice of smoked sausage in it. The beans and rice were a very creamy consistency. The jambalaya was a tasty Creole version, filled with chicken and sausage. The Crawfish Etouffèe (one of my favorite ways to eat crawfish) had a tomato gravy over the rice. There was not a bite left of anything on either of our plates.

The liquid came from a spill that was on the floor at a table behind the table where we were seated.  Michael a supervisor came to our table and did nothing. Then we were told we can get a 10% discount on our meal and come back the next day for breakfast.  The manager Daniel Cavalier then approached our table and said we could have the 10% discount but not free breakfast.  Michael then made a comment to my girlfriend whose skirt was saturated stating his mother would have never complained. What did his mother have to do with our situation? My girlfriends and I came to Oceana to eat , pay for a great meal and get excellent customer service and we did not get what we came for. The food was okay and the customer service experience was awful.  We have no idea what kind of liquid was on the floor.  She/we  could have fell or had an allergic reaction to the liquid that

I really enjoyed chatting with the super nice gentleman at the door. Left with our sundae and went down to Armstrong park to enjoy it. The brownie was hard as a rock!!  And the barely there praline and pecans that might have saved it were way to few to help. So almost $12 for a dessert that we threw away. I'm glad we didn't get lunch there.,2021-02-18 22:58:45

The staff at my hotel suggested we try the restaurant and so did a friend everyone we came across said the restaurant was great for there charbroiled oysters. The mistake I made was not listening to what most of the reviews read which was the oyster were good. Me being the seafood lover I'm I wanted to try there other items on there menu I visited the restaurant with others so we tried different items to get a taste of the seafood the restaurant offered are mistake. We sampled the seafood platter, shrimp po boy, gumbo and there cheeseburger, not the charbroiled oysters. The atmosphere was chill like most places in New Orleans nothing special so I didn't understand why they hyped it up saying make reservations.!  No body was really there we didn't make reservations we just walked in and they seated us.  The waiter was nice and polite and took are order with no problems. The first thing were tried was the gumbo it's not like Cajun or with sausage and crab etc it just had shrimp mild seasoning presentation was great but if your a true gumbo eater pass. Next we tried the seafood platter presentation was great food not so it was  over fried which maded it hard catfish is small like a catfish strip hard over cooked and shrimp same why oyster fried over cooked what took the cake hard huspuppies I have never had that ever!!!! Wow the platter costed $22 on to the next cheeseburger meat ok bun little hard fries also hard the shrimp po boy was large so you thought ok is going to be good not. Bread dry shrimp over cooked I don't want to write a long page it like this the place is over hyped!!! If you go there stick to the charbroiled oysters and I asked a guest as I left what they ordered and did they like it they said yes!! To my surprise into I asked what did they order and they said the Cajun fries and the charbroiled oysters. So if you visited stick to the reviews on the charbroiled oyster don't order off menu a waste of time..  there are other restaurant better the is in the French quarter but I had to try it so if you do write a review I would suggest if you order off the menu make sure you say fresh why should you have to. With the reviews they have I was wanting for that wow moment never got it .

We also had the alligator bites (chewy) and crab cakes. The sauce on the crab cakes was the best part of the meal. Just bottle and sell that. Put it on eggs, Mac and cheese, whatever. It's like cheesy, saucy goodness with some mushrooms for good measure.  

I'm not sure some of the patrons can actually taste anymore. Many are obliterated on various concoctions in adult sippy cups. I'm all for people having a great time - heck, it's NOLA. But 5 stars?!

First we made reservations 2 weeks in advance because we had a large party of 15. We were told a credit card needed to be given to hold our reservation, we said sure no problem then we were told it would  be charge $200 should we fail to arrive on time, again we said sure no problem (although I've never be told that before but it is understandable). We arrive 10 mins early minus 1 because she couldn't make the trip after all ($25 charge, no biggie) we proceed to let the hostess know we  have arrived and there is no reservation for our party. We were told to wait outside until the problem could be sorted as they shuffled people in who just walked up without reservations. 15 minutes later the asst manager informs us that someone from our party called to push back our reservation which none of us did. We finally get seated, we had to squish our party together till another party left to add that table in. Like I said food was delicious our server was awesome and on it for a big party of 14. Turns out the party of 20 behind us called to push back their reservation and whoever took the message pushed BOTH PARTIES back. We never received an apology only made to feel like it was our fault. The manager came out to say since no one can say for sure who made the error (us or them) that he wouldn't charge us the $25 no show fee. We were not rude once we said thank you and went about our business and enjoyed ourselves. I do not care to spend money twice in an establishment that does not have customer service values.

Service was good and I did leave the server a tip but I felt embarassed for them having to serve such nasty fare politely. I knew that this establishment had been publicized on Kitchen Nightmares but assumed that they had benefited from Mr. Ramsey's assistance. Obviously not. I will not return and will never suggest to anyone except hated enemies that they eat here. The City of New Orleans should run the owners out of town for this black eye on decent cuisine.",2013-10-05 00:54:01

Everything we had was decent. I didn't love the poboy as it was dry and didn't have much flavor. The oysters were good but not our favorite. The drinks are freaking delish though! The sampler plate with the three nola specialties was very good, I'd definitely recommend that. The desserts in the case are not what you get though.

 We came here for my sisters birthday, the fact that they are open late! From the time we walked in the staff was friendly and welcoming! It was clean and didn't smell like a seafood restaurant which is a plus! The dinning area an bar were full of cheerful buzz and smiling staff! Everyone from the bus boy welcomed us! 
We were seated with Chris! he gladly welcomed us and explained the menu, we wanted everything! 

Appetizer: BBQ Shrimp Goodness! I had never had New Orleans style BBQ sauce.. ""Pascal Manale"" it was full of flavor rosemary and butter, garlic & worcester sauce. It comes with three slices of French bread, great for dipping! The shrimp are JUMBO!! 

Entree: Shrimp Alfredo with blackened shrimp ! I'm not a big fan of shrimp Alfredo but after reading the menu I had to try it, and I'm glad I did! I had a bowl of noodles cooked just right, smothered in cajun Alfredo sauce! The flavor in every bite equaled a party in my mouth! My goodness it wasn't spicy in heat it was spicy in flavor. The rich creamy sauce was married beautifully with the Alfredo! I even asked for an extra side of Alfredo"" says the I don't care for Alfredo girl""!!! 

Dessert: SAVE ROOM!!! 
After a few deep breaths we made room for the bread pudding! Goodness!  It came in the shape of a big muffin with caramel, chocolate sauce,& whipped cream! At first I was reluctant because bread pudding can either be good or bad.. This was AMAZING! It was browned perfectly which made for a great crust in the outside especially seeing as how you have Carmel and chocolate sauce! As I said earlier bread pudding can be mushy either good or bad.. an this WAS NOT THE CASE! The first bite tasted heavenly! The crust in the outside with the Carmel, chocolate Combo wonderful butter flavor!!! My goodness!!! Part of me wished I had ordered desert first!! 

While we were eating the staff was friendly everyone that walked by wished  my sister happy birthday! I thought it was just cause she had all the birthday flare on, but they were just as friendly to the other tables! That let me know that they want you to feel at home, they want you to feel welcomed and comfortable! The waiter Chris was awesome I know who I will be askin for next time I come in.

Our hotel recommended coming here and we were so happy with the food. In fact we were so happy that we came back a second time a few hours later. The oysters were to die for and were so rich with flavor. The fried gator was very delicious and tender. The pasta was the perfect amount of flavor. We shared the pasta so my picture is about half of the portion. I recommend making an online reservation as it can be quite busy here. The staff was very friendly and accommodation to us during our visit. Our server joe was sweet and gave us great service.

Drinks came fast, then they told us they were out of the chargrilled oysters and could only get the raw, had them before and were not impressed. Why can't you just chargrill some raw ones?? Probably because the kitchen really doesn't cook your food fresh. Then we got our Redfish, it was over cooked or tasted like microwave leftovers. The sauce over it was fresh and the mashed potatoes with vegetables (it was just corn) were fine. Oh then they realized that the bbq shrimp should have come out first, they brought us the bbq shrimp and the sauce was really tasty. The shrimp was NOT gulf shrimp and it had a dinner roll stuffed into the sauce.

We came here at the recommendation of a few tourists and the high ratings on Yelp, seeking our first true Louisiana meal. We got the gator bites (half grilled, half fried) and were pleasantly surprised at the flavor of the grilled ones. Some pieces were a little chewy which could be par for gator. The Taste of New Orleans was ok. The boyfriend enjoyed the crawfish etouffee most but the red beans and rice in my opinion, were the stars of the show. 

The half rack of ribs was really just meh. I've had much better ribs elsewhere. And, I know... this isn't a BBQ restaurant so why order ribs? (Because I don't like seafood all that much.)

Overall, the meal was okay but the boyfriend left craving a more seafood-heavy meal.  I think this is great for the average tourist but I'm sure there are better places to get the staples with more seafood/flavor/heat for less $$.",2018-02-12 14:04:56

The wait was about 45 minutes at 5 PM on a Tuesday. It was perfectly fine though because we were able to order happy hour drinks while waiting, and our children enjoyed watching the fish in the fish tank so we were all happy. The environment is nice and the food was some of the best food I have tasted! I had the surf and turf which was a filet mignon with lobster it also came with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans. Everything on the plate tasted amazing! The steak was juicy, the mashed potatoes were amazing, the green beans were soft but not mushy and the lobster was nice and buttery. My kids shared the penne pasta with marinara which was tasty as well and they ate it all up. For dessert I ordered A peanut butter tart and my husband had them add a birthday message on a plate that came with strawberries and whip cream. Happy hour is till 5:30 so if you can get there at 4 when they open you get cheaper meal prices and drink prices. I enjoyed a tipsy kitty to drink and my friend had the mermaid water I believe, both were good.

They forgot our hush puppies and one of the managers went and got them ASAP. All that for $22 and 2 hungry people can easily share. Place was not crowded at all.

I think its pretty clear by the name of the restaurant that they specialize in seafood. So I would recommend ordering seafood. The wait on a Sunday night was only about 10 minutes for my party of 4. Unfortunately, there is not enough room inside to wait, so we had to stand on the stinky street. We were allowed to bring our drinks from another place into the restaurant though, so that made up for the street smells. We were seated pretty quickly and our waitress was fairly friendly. The restaurant itself also has 3 levels i believe, so that was pretty cool. We were seated on the third level. 

I ordered a half order of oysters (Oceanas favorite) as well as a bowl of gumbo(Seafood). My oysters were cooked perfectly and the sauce was delicious! They were also plated fairly decently. My gumbo looked extremely unappetizing when it came out, but it was very good! It had a great seafood flavor without being overly salty! My friend ordered the crawfish etouffee with fried gator bites as a side and she loved her food. Our two other friends ordered chicken alfredo, and they were both a little disappointed to say the least. The chicken was slightly breaded and the dish was just swimming in a ton of sauce. 

The prices are decent for a seafood restaurant as well. All in all, i would definitely come back. I would suggest anyone coming though, to stick with seafood since it is their specialty. Will i be dreaming of gumbo for the next week...Yes, yes i will. Thank you Oceana!",2016-09-07 00:19:32

Is there a negative star?! All around experience was so incredibly negative, from the customer service, general service,to management I can't fathom I'm the only one who has experienced this outcome.
-offers good allergy menu (+) BUT there isn't a way to order the food online.
-called 3-4 times to try and place order and got the run around, young lady answering the phone was seemingly very inconvenienced by the request to order directly by phone instead of the website (even after explaining that there is no way to order from the food allergy menu online)
-order would take 45 mins to arrive (no problem, that's average to above average wait) -OVER AN HOUR LATER NO FOOD, called and asked if there was an issue AGAIN it was A HUGE INCONVENIENCE FOR THE YOUNG LADY ANSWERING THE PHONE (couldn't give us any information)
-1 1/2 HOURS after placing order I called and requested the manager, HE couldn't give me any information (he called the delivery guy and came back on the phone and apologized)
-2 HOURS after placing the order food arrived, still warm (hmmm ... Doesn't seem like it's been away from the restaurant warmer that long( the manager's only explanation was the delivery guy delivered out of order basically placing the blame on him
-FOOD WASN'T THAT GREAT!!! FOOD WAS MEDIOCRE AT BEST!
-Manager called after the food was delivered and offered us a free dessert the next day if we came into the restaurant, I explained to him this was not an option because of the food allergy which is why we had to call in the order to begin with. He insisted on making it up to us in some way.
- Walked to the location the next day (everyone has bad days, why not give them a chance ) I WAS AGAIN GREETED BY THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE AND GENERAL SERVICE I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED
-The manager took forever to come to the bar (after he was called on the radio, 7 mins later one of the servers went and physically told him to come over - manner said he didn't hear it the request... THOUGH HE HAD AN EARPIECE IN SO HE COULD HEAR THE RADIO )
-AT THIS POINT I'M SO OVER SECOND CHANCES, JUST REFUND THE MEAL! He couldn't offer a refund for the trouble because "" it would mess up his accounting ""(?)

They also tried to give me problems of applying the discount when we ordered just appetizers while waiting for the food at the bar. They said it had to be with an entree, but it doesn't state that anywhere on the yelp offer.

Anyways, the food here is great. I really love their raw oysters; it's so fresh and clean. So you won't be swallowing any sand or parts of the shell. The selection of hot sauces is nice too that you're not only limitEd to just one. We alsO enjoYed the alligator bites. We ordered haLf fried and half blackenEd. But we enjoyed the fried ones more.

Now mind you this was our first meal that we had in New Orleans and was just a walk in right off of Bourbon St. C'mon, that's why everyone is here in one form or another so why not enjoy a little bit of the ambiance. Having not had that much gator being up here in the NW, we don't have any, it was nice to try some of the other foods that many have enjoyed for centuries. The gator was quite delicious, and yes it did taste a lot like chicken. 

However the Redfish, which is just a cheap cut of fish in comparison to Tuna's and Salmons, was outstanding. Well cooked, succulent and moist, this wonderful fish was laid on top of a cornbread stuffing. Just WOW. And I do love some good greens, and these were fantastic. Add to is the wonderful buttery shrimp sauce labeled heavily over the top of the fish and this was a chef special that was simply too good to pass up. Ah yes, I almost forgot about the gumbo. Yes, I ate gumbo at almost every restaurant meal that I could.

Stepped inside to a friendly front desk check in. No reservations no problem. Wife opted for outside courtyard seating. They put us in the back at what I would say is the best table in the house. 

I digress a second - Unlike Court of the Two Sisters who packed in customers side by side and filled the place up to capacity, Oceanagrill followed ""Strict"" Social Distancing guidelines and made sure that not only was the restaurant very sterilized and clean in smell and appearance, but all customers were overly distance from each other. 

Back to the review. We sat down at a clean table and had immediate and may I say Excellent service throughout our meal from waiter Jamal. The menu for breakfast has it all. My wife ordered poached eggs over biscuits with sausage which comes with what I can solidly say are the best grits and home fries I have ever had. She also ordered a small side of Sausage Gravy. I had 2 eggs over easy and an alligator and andouille sausage. It came with a biscuit drizzled with honey over it and their grits and home fries. Everything was outstanding and again the service was spot on! Did I mention that I drink my coffee Black and theirs is strong and delicious; never-ending refills from Jamal.

So when we were on the way here, she told me that we should come for drinks and a late night food trip. Why not, I'm always down to chill with the crew and smash a couple of plates here and there. Plus It's my first time here.

Off the bat, two things jumped out and grabbed my attention. The Crab Cakes and the Jambalaya Pasta. Grabbed a proper pint of Ragin Cajuns Kolsch, put in the order and away we go.

Crab Meat Cakes:     I am a big Crab Cake guy,, and yes I have been to Baltimore and my bar is set pretty gosh darn high when it come to that. The ones served here are really good. Definitely worth ordering specially the way they smother it with their shrimp and mushroom sauce. Two thumbs up!

Cajun Jambalaya Pasta:     Shrimp on every bite. It's as if the Alfredo sauce made love to Jambalaya and had an offspring. This would definitely the direct result of that. It's out of this world. I can't wait to have it again. Plus they give you pieces of bread to mop up what's left on he plate after you're don't smashing.

This spot is definitely a pretty good place to go to if you're visiting NOLA for the very first time. It definitely is touristy, but then what do you expect since it's just off bourbon. Would I come back here again? My answer would be a very strong YES.

In New Orleans (NOLA), there is an abundance of everything so it is hard to find a good thing, especially if your not from around here. Well, my wife and I did it. We found an amazing restaurant that not only delivers after 10PM, but has amazing flavors, hot food, and a good selection of traditional delicacies; e.g. jambalaya, crawfish etouffee, red beans and rice, several blackened items, and Po-Boy sandwiches.

We ate here twice today (Saturday 8/12/18) and will not only recommend this place to EVERYONE we know, but we can't wait to come back to the area to visit it. For lunch my wife had the ""Taste of New Orleans"".  I comes with Jambalaya, crawfish etoufee and red beans and rice with smoked sausage. It was our first time eating the crawfish and red beans (NOLA style) and we loved it. We had Jambalaya before so we knew what to expect and loved it as well. I had an individual order of the red beans and loved it. I would have liked to see another piece of sausage (because it only comes with 1) but it was satisfyingly filling served just the way it was.

Because my wife had a combination of different items, they were packed in individual soup containers to maintain its temperature and flavor. Additionally, all items were packed in such a way that they were easy to open and they stayed sealed to prevent from spilling. I commend the staff working here because they pay attention to detail and the little things can go a long way.

As for our dinner tonight, we switched it up and both ordered Po-Boys and desserts. My wife had the blackened chicken and I had the fried catfish. Both were very delicious and came with fries. We didn't finish them in order to save room for the desserts. They will be excellent breakfast meals in the morning as we travel back up north.

The desserts were fabulous! We had the bread pudding and the pecan pie. The ice cream we got traveled remarkably well for takeout. The whipped cream, not so much. The bread pudding was warm and moist but not soggy. It had a nice balance of raisins in it and came with a delicious caramel sauce to pour on top. The pecan pie was also warm and had a fresh-just-made-today taste.

When we were finished, we tried to connect to wifi to order a ride back to our airbnb but were unable to. 
The restaurant server stepped in and ordered one on her account for us. At the time we thought this was lovely of her, and graciously paid her the amount shown for the ride. 
We went straight to bed and woke up to find my phone was not in my purse. 
I waited until the 8am opening to call the restaurant to see if I had left my phone there. I was told I had not. I asked the manager Tiffany to please track down the server working the past night and ask her to report it missing with uber. She said she would.
The next day when settled back in Canada, I emailed this information into the restaurant along with my address etc to ensure that they had all the details. 
Tiffany responded to say that she would let me know if uber called to report a found phone.
I emailed again to clarify that Uber or LYFT will not be calling, the account holder has to report the phone missing, and they are unable to give any information to anyone other than the account holder. Tiffany seemed to understand and said she would check with the server. By this time it was already Wednesday evening and I was confused that the server hadn't been located.
I emailed Tiffany again on Friday, Saturday and Monday to check the status but she is now ignoring my emails.
A friend of mine decided to call the restaurant for me Monday Jan 28th in the evening to see if the server was back on shift. She was told she'd have to call back and speak to the manager in the morning, and when she asked who she was speaking to, she was hung up on. 
This is incredibly peculiar behaviour from a place of business, offering customer service.
At this point I can only conclude that the manager has not done due diligence, or that the manager or server have stolen my phone. 
There is no conceivable reason that the server who was scheduled last Monday evening couldn't be located within a week's time, and it takes less than a minute to report a lost item through the ride share app.

They were very creamy with just the right amount of cayenne pepper. The beans were served with smoked sausage to compliment. I really appreciated the fact that the smoked sausage was not cooked in the beans, ruining the bean flavor, like so many restaurants do. My only gripe with the dish was the roll served with it. Very doughy and soft, not like the french bread I have been raised on. Otherwise a PERFECT dish.

I would give Oceana a 5, but the music as too loud. Killing the ambiance of our birthday celebration since it was difficult to hear anyone but the person directly next to you. So for that alone, I give it a 4 since I can't give it a 4.5. But Great Food!

The oysters were fine too but just OKAY.

At the time, I didn't know this was my order. After I explained to the manager how his employees had handled themselves he just stayed quiet and said he would refund the cost of the two dishes.

It appeared as though he did not WANT to wait on us, for some reason... I actually told him that he needed to improve his level of service and that we had no silverware
& to bring my gumbo before, not with, my entree. He then returned & placed our silverware in a pile for each of us to divide up. I asked for tartar sauce, Marv brought ranch dressing. Marv brought the checks to us in a stack for us to sort out. I summoned him over & told him to properly give each of us our bill. He then did not properly hand it- but tossed it over! I reported him to Richard, the Manager, who appeared apathetic, was no better and did not seem to have any control over Marv nor did he care that I complained. As we were leaving, Richard began his sentence with ""The next time.."" and one person in our quartet looked at Richard and immediately and angrily replied ""There will not be a next time!!!""

We also had a weird delivery mixup where they forgot a gumbo. They said they'd come back and get it to us but it was somehow dropped off at the wrong hotel which is weird. When it finally came, it was also mediocre food. It tastes like gumbo we'd get in like Seattle.

*Blackened Alligator bites (if its you're first time get the half/half - blackened and fried)
*Red Fish
...I think anything blackened will be delicious here

Don't get:

This was only my first food stop when I was there, & I was extremely overwhelmed with joy. Everything was so good especially the famous oysters. I also had the redfish special which was decent, but had a taste of a friend's redfish etouffee which was even better so I would get that instead next time. The blackened alligator bite was an amazing snack as well. The jambalaya was just okay to me, it had a ""spaghetti-y"" flavor which I wasn't expecting (not sure what authentic jambalaya is supposed to taste like but I didn't care for it here), & both the shrimp & chicken gumbo was really good here when Louisiana hot sauce was added.

Came back here another time & had crawfish  Cajun fries, SO good. Also, shared both Jambalaya pasta as well as the chicken Alfredo. Both pastas needed more seasoning for sure. I wouldn't come back for the pasta next time.

The reason I gave it 4 stars is because after trying other places, I realized there were better chargrilled oysters & jambalaya elsewhere (refer to ACME on yelp & to my Coterie review). I definitely think this place is just a popular touristy restaurant & would suggest you look into other restaurants for specific dishes that its known for. However, if it's your first time in NO like it was mine, going here to experience it at least once wouldn't be a bad choice. I still feel like you'd leave here with a happy tummy like I did.

At a glance, I thought it would be a typical Nola, kind of cheesy, seafood place where I couldn't eat anything (I'm a vegetarian). We saw online that there were a couple dishes that were vegetarian-friendly but not very exciting, like fettucine alfredo.

In actuality, the interior is pretty unique - lots of different levels to the restaurant, a really cool courtyard in the middle, balcony you can stand on, kind of hard to find your way around in but the staff was so friendly and very attentive to people wandering around looking lost. Good lighting and volume in the place - you could hear a background of people talking but also hear everyone at your table too. 

Servers were awesome, very casual and friendly, very happy to explain dishes and options. 

At first, I was disappointed because the menu in the restaurant did not have any of the vegetarian friendly options on it that are on the website. This is my major critique - the menu on site should have these items on it. Luckily, we asked the server and she confirmed that these options were still available, just ""off-menu."" I ordered the spinach ravioli expected it to be pretty basic and underwhelming. I was wrong!!! It was very well made and had super fresh spinach and kale cooked in, great seasoning, great cheese filling. I also ordered a cocktail which was super cool - they use dry ice in most of them which was fun, and it was seriously delicious, AND it was only like 8 bucks. Usually anything fancy with dry ice will run you $12+. I would go back just for drinks if I was able to.

The crab cakes were really good! I really liked the sauce and even had to ask for a side of it. I ended up getting the alligator pasta which was interesting.

It was another restaurant that was recommended by some other visitors that we met along the way. Since they did not suggest anything in particular, we decided to stop by for a late dinner. It is conveniently located in the French Quarter right off Bourbon Street, so it was pretty busy when we arrived. We were greeted and seated immediately upon entering the establishment. The first level was full, so we were escorted to the second level, where we had a brief wait for our order to be taken.

It was not a fancy restaurant by any means and was pretty true to the word ""grill"". It was a standard bar and grill with a variety of creole selections. When in New Orleans, my goal is to try local fare and to stay away from food choices that I can get at home. With that in mind, I decided on the crawfish étouffée. Personally, I would have preferred shrimp étouffée, but I decided to give it a try. While it was not my first rodeo with crawfish, I am not sure if it is my favorite. I did take into consideration that I was feeling a little queasy that day from the New Orleans heat, as well as my earlier Bourbon Street activities. 

Nevertheless, I ordered the bbq shrimp appetizer and the crawfish étouffée entree.  The bbq shrimp, though tasty was a little overly seasoned, but was good with the pieces of bread for dipping in the sauce. I would definitely order again under better circumstances. As for the crawfish étouffée, I loved the gravy base and the rice. Unfortunately, the crawfish overpowered the dish in terms of quantity. Perhaps, it was just how I was feeling at that particular moment, but I had to put about 20 pieces to the side and I had already consumed a great many of them.  

The crawfish were very small and very abundant in the dish. The texture was a little off-putting in this particular dish. With a similar visual and textural comparison to shrimp, I thought the dish would have been better if the crawfish were cooked a little firmer. I might have felt differently had they been shrimp, but who knows? I did thoroughly enjoy the gravy and rice part of the dish along with the dipping bread; that part was just what my stomach required. In consideration that I have enjoyed the shrimp variety of étouffée in many other restaurants, this really did not deliver on flavor, but maybe that was a good thing in this instance. 

I would try them again and order something else or maybe ask if shrimp could be substituted for the crawfish. I would prefer five or six jumbo shrimp over what seemed to be 50 pieces of crawfish any day.",2019-07-02 22:56:37

Waiter was great, fast and attentive. Food was served pretty quick. 

Food was exactly what you're looking for if in search of creole. 

I got a sampler plate I believe it was the red fish, I got it blackened! Best way to have it, served with red mashed potatoes and corn for sides. 

Blacked fish was delicious, mashed potatoes great! 

Jambalaya and beans was about a 3 1/2 out of 5, fried shrimp were nice and big and really good.

Our wait staff messed up 3 times She gave Hubby an iced tea when he ordered diet soda. BFF hubby initially ordered coffee but quickly changed to tea and she brought a cup of coffee that had lipstick smears on the rims. She changed it to tea. 
I requested a cup of gumbo and was brought a bowl and she insisted I ordered a bowl, which I didn't as Hubby heard me and told her it was a cup.
It was corrected. The wait staff needs more training and to prevent mishaps again, should repeat the orders to the customers. 

My oyster po boy was OK. The fried oysters were very good but I didn't like the cole slaw as much. The fries are standard frozen one which were crispy. The seafood gumbo was Ok but I've had better elsewhere. Lots of shrimp in it. 
Hubby had the chicken gumbo and said it was good. He ordered the Cajun fries which were smothered in cheese, seafood.  Reminded me of poutine. I didn't care for it. 

BFF liked her catfish platter. The fish was tender but tastEd like catfish. Her hubby had shrimp po boy and he said it was good.

I really enjoyed the eggplant fries and the fried shrimp. The shrimp has a really good seasoning with just a bit of spice so they were a hit.

We figured the wait would be 30 minutes to an hour (I'm sure the line looked longer due to social distancing as well).  But not too long after standing in line, someone came walking down the line asking for a party of two.  Apparently everyone ahead of us had a big party or had a party of three.  YAY for us!

We got seated immediately and ordered some drinks like usual.  Took a look at the menu and ended up ordering: Cajun Fries, Crawfish Étouffée Sample, and a Soft Shell Crab as our appetizer.  We ordered a Cajun Jambalaya Pasta to share (I wasn't too hungry).  

Even though I didn't order an entree for myself, it was more than enough food to share.  Everything was AMAZING!  Thank goodness for our waiter who asked if we wanted a 1/2 order of Cajun Fries or a Full Order.  We decided to go with the 1/2 order and wholly cow, it was A LOT! I'm so glad we got the 1/2 order, it wasn't an option on the menu so I'm glad she told us otherwise we might have wasted food (but then again, it was so good....I might have just finished it and regretted it). 

The Crawfish Étouffée sample was a tease....but still glad we didn't order a whole entree because we would have been stuffed.  

The Soft Shell Crab was DELICIOUS!!!

The Cajun Jambalaya Pasta was packing in flavor and had a good kick to it.  Maybe a bit much for my husband, but I loved it.

I opted for the Maw Maw's Country breakfast - the bacon, eggs and jambalaya rice all tasted fresh.  I also ordered a screwdriver because it's still breakfast and it's still New Orleans. 

The orange juice hit the spot and the drink was nice and strong.  

My husband ordered the biscuits and gravy, I was shocked to see that he was served basically a bowl of gravy with a spoon and two biscuits.  That's not how I'd want to eat my biscuits and gravy but it tasted good to me and he was stuffed.  We actually even took some leftovers with us.

This restaurant is open during the current COVID-19 pandemic, which I'm happy about however I've just realized they have some unethical business practices and taking advantage of customers. I've been ordering from them a lot lately as I currently moved from another city to New Orleans and staying in a hotel until I find a home. I've been frequenting this restaurant lately and I always wonder why the bill seemed abnormally high based on what I ordered. Tonight after ordering my food, I  looked at my itemize receipt and realized they are charging 10%+ more on their food items. I called the restaurant and the response I got was that before the pandemic they were intending on raising their prices, so they have maintained their increased prices and also said that they just did not have anybody on hand to update their prices online. Frankly, most businesses that are open are offering specials and/or lowered menu prices, but Oceana has gone in the opposite direction.

When I went with a large group, everyone seemed to enjoy the crab cakes. It's nice the menu offers blacken options for the poboys and that there is a vegetarian menu. I've tried everything on the vegetarian menu; here are my thoughts.
1.Vegetarian Pasta = TERRIBLE. Don't order it. The vegetables aren't cooked and the pasta isn't anything special. I ended up asking for cheese and hot sauce to eat some of it. Better off with a plain salad.
2. Spinach Ravioli is pretty good. I like it with the cream sauce and I would definitely eat it again if I return.
3. Cajun Vegetarian Stew is an ok dish. I love stew and curry, so maybe I'm a bit of a stew snob. I didn't find the seasoning to hit the mark; so maybe ask for hot sauce for this one.",2020-10-12 20:46:01

First of all I was greeted by a friendly staff. Then by Jessica as she served me. Super nice and friendly waitress. Really makes for legitimacy when you have such a solid staff. Not just her, all the staff was amazing. 
So the food----
Red Beans and Rice.   I rate 9 out of 10---remember to mix them upon arrival as to not look like a rube (me). 
Crab cakes-------------------------------------I would rate 8 out of 10.
But please remember, I used to live in SF for 20 years, so the bar is Golden Gate Bridge high. I loved the cakes here, they were very tasty, with a nice outer crust, yet the insides were moist and luscious. The sauce was incredible--even having sizable chucks of fresh crab meat in it. Very good, only beat by my SF local spots.
Mustard Greens---------Not rating. This is an acquired taste for sure. I took a second bite of it just to make sure I got the flavor. Potent is the best word to describe it. If you don't like potent food, pass on these. 
Mashed potatoes---------Passing grade, nothing to point out--they did their function as potatoes.   
I liked my dinner, it was very good.

I also came back later--I ran into a couple of co-workers who were hungry (here on a business meeting).  I led them back to here, one friend ordered the Oysters and he said, WOW.  My other friend ordered the blackened fish special they offered.  He was so happy he was taking food pics and sending them.  So this is a solid restaurant with a wide range of dishes that people love.  When I ate at 5:30pm, no wait.  At 6:30pm, my friends had to eat at the bar because there was a line.

the lines were confusing. line without reservation is on one side, and with reservation is on the other side but just much shorter. so while we were waiting on the reservation line. there were people without reservation who thought the reservation line is the regular line. i think they gotta tell people which line is which to avoid confusion.

we ordered a bunch a of stuff, family style as always for a party of 6.
- a dozen of raw oysters
- gator tail bites (half fried half blackened)
- crab cakes
- fried oysters
- taste of new Orleans
- redfish Oceana
- Cajun jambalaya pasta
- Mardi Gras pasta.
- bread pudding

i would say the crab cake and jambalaya pasta were the best. their golden cadillac (if i aint mistaken) margarita was one of the best i've ever had.

they ran out the char-grilled oysters? not sure how. maybe just no charcoal that day? cuz the raw oysters were available.

one of the oysters came empty (shell only) lol, told them the server and she bought another one. our server were wonderful and attentive.

We come to New Orleans once or twice a year and had never been. We are huge Gordon Ramsey fans and we saw this restaurant featured on one of his shows.

As we approached the restaurant we saw a long line outside, we bypassed and told the girl at the door that we had reservations. She looked mad at the world and was anything but friendly. (wish we had gotten names) We were told to stand to the left and wait with the others who also had reservations. After about 5 minutes we were told to go to the desk and as we approached 3 staff members were gathered and completely ignored us. After standing there feeling completely invisible and getting very much annoyed I said ""Brown table for 2"" at which time the hostess blatantly stared beyond us and ignored us. I looked at my husband like 'what is happening?' and he had the same bewildered look on his face. We were never acknowledged by the hostess who seemed to have a huge chip on her shoulder that we were inconveniencing her.

I ordered dinner from the bar. I started out with the classic Sazarac. It was the predecessor to the old-fashioned. Between the two, I think I'd go with the Sazarac!  $9 for a good stiff drink. 

For food, I went with the blackened redfish etouffee. $20. It came with rice and corn. It took a cool minute to get my food, but as I said, it was really busy. My food was delivered lukewarm. It was still good. The bartender heated it up for me again and it did help. I would have loved to had it hot off the grill though. That being said it was all spiced just right and very flavorful, all of it. 

For dessert, I had their highlighted bread pudding.$5.50. It's like a muffin and a very tasty one at that.

Even though it's a tourist haven, it doesn't mean the food isn't authentic and awesome.

I ordered their crab cakes then did their shrimp pasta w/ blackened chicken as my entree. And wow to both items. I'm not sure what was better.. their food or customer service?

 We discovered this place through a friends suggestion who was in NOLA last week. We started off at a restaurant (who shall remain nameless) with alligator bites for an app, we happened to scroll through Yelp while snacking and came across Oceana Grill.
We decided to dump the joint we were at and head to Oceana which was right around the corner. Best choice we ever made!!!
We had:
BBQ Shrimp. = amazing 
Seafood Gumbo = very good 
Crab Cakes w/garlic Mashed Potatoes and Collard Greens = Awesome 
Oceana's Famous Oysters = unbelievable

Now come on this is the NOLA I barley got any etouffee sauce, the mash potatoes and mustard greens had no flavor as well, I had to drown the mustard greens in hot sauce and on top of it all it was cold. The soft shell crab po boy my boyfriend got was also  terrible, all French bread and no crab.  The double shot tropical storm don't even waste your time it was so weak I didn't even finish it .
Last the creme brulee  tasted like cheap vanilla pudding with day old burnt caramel sauce  (smdh)  This place is way to overpriced and sadly just disappointing we will not be back and I won't be recommending this sad disgusting place to anyone.",2020-12-09 06:16:05

They were able to take us right in with smiles. Our server ""Fee"" was wonderful - informative and attentive. Not all of us were familiar with New Orleans fare and she answered every question and had great suggestions. We started with the Alligator bites - half grilled, half fried - which are definitely the way to go! Both were flavorful and had the perfect texture. We also had their crab cakes which were smothered with a mushroom craw fish sauce - yummy. Apps were a good size. There were 7 of us and we each got a couple bites of each. We ordered oysters as an app as well but those came out at the same time as our meals for some reason.

I had really had a tough time choosing an entree but went with a dozen of the Oysters Rockafeller and was so happy with my choice. I've actually never had the famous dish before and I think this was the perfect place to try it. Bacon, spinch, buttery goodness, perfectly cooked oyster and grilled flavor OMG.

The restaurant is really eye catchy and you tend to get lost looking at everything. They also have a lot of seating on several floors. 

What I didnt like was that they made us wait outside, in a line for about 30+ min, which would have been ok, except once we got inside, I noticed that they had SEVERAL tables that were empty and not reserved. When I asked about it, they just shrugged. They also had inside waiting seats, but werent allowing anyone to sit in those either. I had to take my daughter to the bathroom at one point, but it was bad because it was so hot. Hotter than it was outside. I figured it must be next to a kitchen or something, they just need a bit better ventilation or AC in there. We were sweating by the time we got out of there. 

What I hated: We came here strictly for gator tail. My husband really wanted to try it. What we got was tiny and I do mean tiny, bits of nuggets that were mostly breading. It was about 10 pieces, and 3 of them were strictly breading only. We were also charged about $10 for this tidbit of food. I asked the waiter about it and he said it was a normal serving. I also ordered their signature baked oysters on the half shell. They were bad. I couldnt eat them after the first one. They tasted like old fish and smell worse. I also mentioned this to the waiter but he said there was nothing wrong with them. We got charged another $10 for that. 

The kids meals came as described, but the kids said they tasted funny. They kinda did. They had a weird rubbery taste to them. But I also had just eaten one of the oysters, so I attributed it to that. I got the small cup of gumbo (came with hardly anything in it) and my husband got what I consider the most expensive po'boy ever. The gumbo was ok and the po'boy was ok. We never got our 3rd kids meal, and I had to point that out several times when the check came, cause they still charged us for it. We finally got that removed. We ordered the kids some shirley temples because they had been good, but we got charged $7 for EACH drink. It doesnt have alcohol in it. Its sprite/7up with Grenadine. So very friendly waiter, ok food and not so great food. There are a few other places we will probably eat at next time.",2018-07-27 01:00:30

I will try to be straight across-the-board with this review. Over the last 10 years we've been to New Orleans 10 or 12 times we've  eaten at the Oceana almost every time. The food was always great as was the service. Today it was a completely different story. The steak or should I say steaks as my wife and I each ordered one. The steaks were as thick as a deck of cards and may be 2 inches longer than a deck of cards, you can see the fork in the picture to show how small the steak was, now if you've ever had dinner at Ruth's Chris or Maguires in Pensacola you know what a ribeye steak should look like. Believe it or not that steak in the picture was $29!! I thought when I saw the price it had to be an absolutely fantastic steak I couldn't have been more wrong. Here's how it went, we arrived there they were slightly busy no busier than we've ever seen, we were seated it took a waitress 10 minutes to get to us no problems so far but at this point we knew we needed to order our drinks and food and appetizer all at the same time, been through this before with other restaurants. Waitress came we gave her our full order, 20 minutes later he comes the food in this order, steaks came before the drinks, the appetizers came after the steaks, now are you picking up what I'm laying down? I fully understand that restaurants are understaffed for quality servers, cooks and managers but it kept getting worse. We have never been to the Oceana and not had a manager come up and ask us how everything was going and how our meal was, this time was the first time no manager came up, and now thinking of it I realized why. Getting our food getting our drinks getting what we paid for just seemed like we were pulling teeth every step of the way, the worst part of all of it is I know will never go back there again as it's obvious that the owner of the business does not care or he would be in there making sure to keep his reputation in great shape. I'm sure that more bad reviews will come in do to extremely poor management and ownership that must be going on there. As far as leaving a tip we love to tip so much so we have many many times had our credit card company contact us and ask us to verify because our tips are so large in this situation we did not leave a tip and I wrote on the bill about how unhappy we were with the service and the food. The ownership needs to get it together. They Brag and show pictures of NFL football players eating there my wife made a comment that if a football player would've seen the steak they put on our plates they would've laughed it right off the table. I can't tell you how upset I am mainly because I know We will never be able to go back there again. Oceana if you're going to charge $29 for a steak at least have it be bigger than what Walmart sells.",2021-07-02 01:02:44

We started off with a mimosa and another before my Oceana Famous Bloody Mary was dropped off.  The mimosas were very good but this BM was INCREDIBLE!  It had 6 fried shrimp, 6 fried oysters and 2 fried soft shell crabs on top of the smoothest BM I've had down here.  Yumm...!

Next came the BBQ Shrimp in New Orleans bbq sauce which is a butter/flour base (NOT tomato) and it comes with bread to sop up all that delicious rue.... Yumm...!!

Next was Oceana's Famous Oysters with more of that bbq sauce & a bread crumb mixture on top of a dozen fire grilled oysters.  Oh yea...!

For an entree, I HIGHLY recommend the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. 10/10 meal. I am not someone who likes super spicy food, and I can tell you that I LOVED this meal. Not too spicy, the sauce was just right. Shrimp and alligator sausage mixed in with fettuccine pasta and that irresistible sauce. By far one of the best meals I've ever had... and so much food that I couldn't even finish it all and ended up bringing some home.

Dessert is not even in question.... I am not a huge ""toffee"" or ""coffee"" person, but I love anything chocolate, so I had to get the Chocolate Kahlua Mousse....... shared it with my date and it definitely was the icing on the cake of the meal.

We were visiting New Orleans from Dallas and we made reservation to go to Oceana since this was one of the recommended restaurant. I made reservation prior to even leaving Dallas. When we walked in we were glad we made reservation because omg the line is crazy. We waited probably like 10 minutes when we got there and we were seated. Our waiter's name was Jacelynn I believe. She was super nice and she was attentive even though it was very busy in there. I read about a drink with Jolly Rancher and I ordered it and it was way too sweet and not my type of drink but it was something good to try. My husband got the margarita and he really enjoyed his drink. I was not very hungry so I decided to do the crab cake which is an appetizer as a meal and the portion size was huge and I am glad I got that. It was ok honestly since I have had better crab cake but still good I would say. My husband got the mardi gras pasta and he added crab meat. He said it was good but he would not order again since he did not care for it too much.Overall I felt like the food was good and I would definitely go back again since the prices were decent too. I would not wait 3 hours to go in but if I had reservation and did not have to wait I would visit again when I go back to New Orleans. The waitress made the visit BETTER for sure since she was extremely friendly and just overall very nice.,2021-07-05 23:46:54

CAJUN JAMBALAYA PASTA
- excellent firm fettuccini, with super yummy sauce, flavorful seafood/shrimp/alligator sausage, this is pretty damn awesome and definitely a must get

Blackened Catfish - yummy and soft with good seasoning

Gator bites - get the mixed fried and blackened, they go well with the delicious remoulade sauce that comes on the side!

TASTE OF NEW ORLEANS
- Creole jambalaya , crawfish etouffée, red beans & rice with smoked sausage - a very good saucy mix of items good for sharing, i would recommend this dish

I made reservations the night before because the first night we thought about getting dinner there, the line was really long (not just there but literally every place we were thinking about dining in) so reservations is the way to go! My only complaint is where we were sat felt like it didn't have any air what so ever so it made the time there a little uncomfortable especially since we had walked almost a mile to get there & it was 90 degrees. So some air would've made the experience a lot better. The food was amazing. I'm sure COVID has a lot to do with the service and being short staffed & the current staff being stretched thin. Our waiter was super nice, the only thing was I think our adult beverages weren't put in and we didn't receive them til we were already eating our entrees.

Oceana Grill was highly recommended by many of the locals and there were a lot of great reviews so my friends and I had to check it out. We ordered several different entrees to share so we could try everything and I liked most of the dishes we ordered!

A quick rundown of what we ordered:
- Fresh Oysters: Can't go wrong with these! 
- Oceana's Famous Oysters: This was too salty in my opinion. 
- Louisiana Crabmeat Cakes: These were okay. Nothing too special. 
- Blackened Gator Tail Bites: We tried a gator dish at every restaurant we went to in New Orleans and this one was by far the best! I recommend you try this! 
- Fried Catfish: These were good but felt like a fried food overload because it also came with a side of fries. 
- Redfish Oceana: Comes with a side of mashed potatoes and collard greens. Everything about this dish was delicious! 
- Cajun Jambalaya Pasta: This was my favorite dish! It was well seasoned and very flavorful. 
- Crawfish Etouffee: Not as flavorful as I hoped. I would pass on ordering this.

When we finally got inside we saw that the place wasn't even really that full - maybe 70%. Figures they were probably throttling the customers a little bit as to not overload the servers. 

Anyway - we ended up getting seated upstairs which was cool. Our drinks unfortunately took a long time to come out. Our server said they ran out of root beer upstairs so.. I guess they had to go find some downstairs.. but it shouldn't take 15 min to walk a flight of stairs right? Food came out shortly after the drinks and then the waitress disappeared for a while. She never came back to check on us by the time we finished our meal. We ended up having to flag 2 different people down just to find her. We did end up ordering some desserts and they came out ok.

2,073 reviews for Oceana and I bet, like Acme, 90% queued for a table. Sure the efficient staff are friendly and prices are moderate but the seafood is just average (pic). Opt for these comparable nearby alternatives if you can't get seated:

1. ""Desire"" - affordable, classic tile and panel Creole café, career employees, sit at the shucker bar;
2. ""MRB's""- a neighborhood favorite, bar food with excellent char-grilled oysters;
3. ""Deanie's"" - Applebeesish, reasonably priced adequate seafood;
4. ""New Orleans Hamburger & Seafood"" - kid friendly local chain, get the garlic fries;
5. ""Royal House"" - seafood's a tad over priced, sit on the romantic balcony.
And if someone else is paying:
6. ""GW Fins""; or if lucky
7. ""Pêche"".

REGARDLESS, REFUSE TO SIT IN THE REAR!
Don't let them entomb you in their claustrophobic back room. If you are going to wait an hour for a table you should hold out for the main dining area.

Most times you have to ""doctor"" on them with butter and salt and pepper and cheese if you can get it.  Someone's auntie that was taught to make grits by her great grandma made these grits.  These grits needed nothing! Delicious! The sausage, crab cake and scrambled eggs were tasty but the next star was the biscuit.  Dripping in honey butter, thick and light and flaky with a touch of strawberry jam.  I want to come back here tomorrow and the next day thats how good it is AND its a stone's throw from my hotel.",2021-05-14 17:17:38

Take your oily, swampy BBQ shrimp and stay away from me. The only reason I went here was for a taping of Chef Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares. My friend and I thought it would be a fun experience. Aside, from the surreal experience of taping a reality show, the service was great. Our server was pleasant, attentive, and prompt. If only the food was edible!!

We ordered the BBQ shrimp appetizer. I'm from New Orleans and I've had many versions of this dish, good and bad. This was by far the worst!  Not only was the sauce filled with old oil, puddles of oil, but the shrimp were overcooked. I literally had to use my fingernail to scrape the peel off. Gross!  I ordered the Redfish Oceana as an entree.  Bad idea!  It's described as a sauteed redfish filet with a yummy sauce.  Instead, I received a thickly breaded fried piece of fish that was NOT redfish.  It was a tiny, filet of white fish.  I'm pretty sure it was tilapia.  This fish was super white and almost non-existent.  I told my server I must have received the wrong thing.  She assured me that's how it's always served and it was indeed redfish.  She was either lying to me or herself, most likely both.  

May I also note, that my friend and I both felt horrible later that night and into the next day.  I had to eat crackers and drink ginger ale at work.  If it were just me, I'd call it coincidence but we were both sick.  I wasn't surprised when I mentioned this to others and they had suffered the same effects in the past.

I hopefully(idiotically) returned a few weeks later to the same situation.  Friendly and attentive servers with disgusting, ill-inducing food.  I would have thought things would be revamped after 'Kitchen Nightmares.' The only reason this place is still in business is because of all the tourists visiting the French Quarter.  This slop will not fly with anyone who has any experience with tasty, New Orleans seafood.  If you are considering eating here...don't!

Neither did the establishment itself look anywhere inviting. If anything, I thought it looked like some lame joint that had really weird lighting effects and filled with crazies invoking voodoo magic to empty out the wallet of anyone unaware. However, before I was able to drag the lady along and away down Bourbon Street...the main door swung open and out stampeded a large group of about 20+ happy-looking diners quickly exiting and scattering into the night seeking more action.

Yet, one diner was not quick to disappear like the rest. Not only did he hold the door open for the outgoing stampede...he also continued to hold it open for us with a smile and beckoned that we enter by saying ""AMAZING FOOD...get in and enjoy!"" I swear no extra persuasion was needed after that scene and we both entered expecting that this place would at least be ""okay"" if a group that huge had just left with satisfied looks.

Well, friendliness greeted us, sat us, gave us menus, and made us immediately feel welcome. Service was eager to please from the start and was matched with an efficient kitchen that set out piping hot dishes shortly after the order was placed. I didn't particularly like the ambiance - especially the lighting - and greasy floors have always peeved me. But this all is secondary...we only care about the food right?

I forgot to order any form of oysters here - that's my fail. I did, however, order stuff I didn't order elsewhere: (a) Cajun Alligator Sausages were just a tube of meaty grease. Beef is added to offset the lean gator meat; however, the beef also dominated the flavor profile. I'd say to skip this one and (b) turtle soup...I'd also skip this one unless you are just craving a bowl of chili. Once again, all the other ingredients just dominate the flavor profile that you wouldn't be able to tell if contained turtle or rat or cow or horse or DRAGON.

The entrees, however, are worth a revisit. My fair lady ordered the Taste of New Orleans, which contained the main staples - jambalaya, crawfish etouffee, red rice and beans, and a sausage to top it off. We welcomed the intense flavors with absolute delight and cleaned the plate to a shiny clean hue. I ordered the catfish special, which came blackened and topped off with fried crawfish tails and a side of steamed veggies. This was easily the highlight of the meal...while there was enough crawfish tails to make another dish, it was the amazingly seasoned and properly cooked catfish that blew our minds away as each piece melted-away-in-our-mouth!

On my second attempt we were again told a ""20 minute wait"" and we waited closer to 45 minutes. I learned that they dont contact you when your table is ready. It actually is a covid list with your name and number they have you sign while you're waiting outside in line before even actually getting seated. 

The wait was worth it in the end however. I have to say the food was really good. The waitress was friendly and helpful. I ordered from a picture I saw on yelp from 2 years ago, asking the waitress what it was. It turns out it was the Oceana Redfish Lafourche, which I was told was actually removed from the menu. It was still able to be ordered however. I was told it was redfish with fried crawfish, crawfish etouffee, and jambalaya rice underneath. It was amazing, I must say. My friend ordered the seafood gumbo and it was also very good. Another friend ordered the fried shrimp platter. It had so much food but for the price, the sharing was worth it.

My boyfriend got a pasta and that was okay - it was just pretty standard. 

What tops off the cherry on the cake was that this was one of our most expensive meals during the trip! And I'm always for paying for great food, but this was definitely not it. I'm not sure if this is just a one-off experience, but I definitely wouldn't be back.

Gator bites, both blackened and fried split half and half. It had great flavor to it. Gator meat is a bit chewy so it's important to have good seasoning and this place had it. 4 out of 5 sporks.

It's mostly batter that's fried with a little moisture inside. We also got the pasta, Cajun/Creole. That was also good but pretty basic. We had to add some spices and salt to it because it needed a little bit more of that but when you're hungry and you want some flavor it's delicious. They have a weird seating system where they don't really take your name and they just call out ""party of two"" And if you're standing outside and someone walks in front of you they could just as easily go. Additionally, there's tons of space upstairs but they make you wait to be seated, I'm not sure why. The service is great as far as the waiter is concerned and he was really nice and fast.

This is an incredibly tasty way to try out all of the NOLA classics. My mom got the Redfish which came with a super tasty mushroom sauce. My dad ordered the Shrimp Alfredo which was less of a traditional Alfredo, and more of a cheesy sauce. He really enjoyed it, although there wasn't a whole lot of shrimp.

The drinks were good - no complaints and received them quickly. 
I ordered the ""signature dish"" - reddish and my husband got the duck.  The redfish was waaaaaay overcooked and there was barely any sauce on it - and I definitely needed it with overcooked fish like that. The corn was kind of...not good and the mashed potatoes were just ok. My husbands duck was fairly good, though a bit dry.  We were not checked on until my husband was nearly done  with his meal and the female employee asked how things were. I told her ok and she seemed to be offended and asked me why wasn't it great? So I told her. She did offer a new piece of fish but at that point why bother when my husband was done with his meal, so I declined.  That was the only compensation they offered and I did not finish the meal.
Our waiter was pleasant but very very slow coming back to our table. We were finished with our meal for almost 15 minutes before he finally came over and asked if we wanted dessert. It was not very busy at all that night.  We declined and simply asked for the check to leave.

My friend ordered the seafood platter, which was HUGE with lots of deep fried tender fish, shrimp, oysters and jalapeno hushpuppies. Definitely would love to order this myself next time. 
So. A couple things to note. There generally is a line outside the door. For some reason the hostesses didn't want to seat our party of two - not sure if it was because we declined a seating at the bar rather than at a table. They seated 3 parties of 3 and eventually sat us after I said ""....hey, wait a second....maybe we DO have 3 people in our party after all!"" Long story short, John, our waiter, and the service manager apologized and handled things very well (and gave us a free dessert - the bread pudding, served with cream and homemade caramel sauce, is to die for!!!).

My biggest issue is the dishonesty that was displayed. The waitress stated that any double shot would be $5. Once we got our bill, we were charged for the drinks we ordered and $5 added to each drink total. When we asked about the discrepancy, another waiter said that the manager told them to frame it that way. I found this dishonest and misleading.

- Bowl of Seafood Gumbo $9.50 Very good, but it was room temperature... not hot at all. 
- Redfish Oceana $20 I ordered mine ""blackened"" and was blown away by how good it was.. came with delicious mustard greens and garlic mash. A+
- Mardi Gras Pasta $19 Pasta topped with crawfish and shrimp... it was creamy and yummy but not mind-blowing, in my opinion. 

What turned me off:
- They brought our soup (ordered as a starter/appetizer) AFTER they brought our entrees.... doesn't make sense... and if you're going to take so damn long, at least make sure the soup is hot! 
- They killed THREE cockroaches in front of us while we were eating!

First of all, our waiter took our complete order just after sitting down and did not even bother to ask two of the four people at the table what they wanted to drink.

So two of the four people sat without drinks for easily 15 minutes or more.

Next, we ordered a cheeseburger poor boy with nothing on it. It was delivered to our table with lettuce on it. This might not seem like a big issue to some people, but the person eating it definitely did not want anything on it.

Definitely the portions were very underwhelming. If you go there hungry, you probably should order more than one thing from the menu.

Shockingly, the kids chicken fingers was a larger portion then the main entrées that were ordered.

The reason I actually gave it to stars is because the people eating the seafood platter said that it was amazingly tasty and they were very happy with the quality of it.

Personally, I was rather disappointed with the experience and would not recommend it to any family or friends

Order: Blackened Gator Bites app, Blackened Chicken Po Boy, Jambalaya Pasta

Great way to enjoy good Cajun food and the French Quarter. Conveniently located in the French Quarter 3 streets from where the buses run on Canal Street (Bourbon St exit). Like many of the places in the FQ, you enter a small door to the restaurant. Real estate is scarce (and expensive) so the place is small with tables sitting close to each other, but not so close you are bumping elbows. With all the tables consolidated, it feels a bit cramped in the restaurant. And the noise level is pretty loud. 

Service is fantastic and fast! Jamal was very attentive, always checking on us. He's laid back, friendly and informative. 

The Gator Bites was highly recommended by an ex-culinary guy who worked as a chef at one of the restaurants in the FQ. I didn't think there was anything to rave about but it was good.  The Blackened Chicken Po Boy was very good as was the fries that came with it (has a crunchy coating too).  The Jambalaya Pasta was spiced well and came in a very large bowl!

Other than the cramped feel, this place is definitely worth checking out.  Highly recommended!",2019-12-19 05:36:28

I have never in my entire life been treated so poorly - not even in France. I was with a group of 110 people and we had a banquet planned at Oceana. That afternoon we confirmed that our room would be ready by 6:30 PM. We arrived at 7:00 PM, hoping that if they were late, that us arriving a bit late would give them extra time. With 110 people, there is no room for error. The restaurant started by not even apologizing for being late. Not a huge deal - just poor execution and poor attention to detail.

With the food, we asked for a modified menu because of dietary differences in this group of 110. Not one of those was followed from no caesar dressing to putting the meat on the pasta on the side so that vegetarians could enjoy the salad and the entree. 

As we began the program - keep in mind we had a very important keynote speaker - they started their garbage disposal in the bar. We could not hear our speaker and when we asked them to turn it off they just put up their hands and shrugged their shoulders. They purposely repeated this garbage disposal routine three other times - all during out program when nobody was actually going to the bar. Totally unacceptable.

To finish it up, the night ended with us demanding to lower the tip based on poor service and preparation. When we demanded it be lowered, the manager called the cops - not something you want to have happen to you in a place with such a corrupt police department. Two cops came in - one in uniform and one uncover straight out of a bad episode of Sopranos. At the end of everything, the manage said to my face, ""I don't care about your money.

Staff is friendly but service was on the slower side. My husband and I got an order of the chargrilled oysters, which was recommended, and we shared the friend platter of shrimp and fish. This was our first time having chargrilled oysters and they were very good. Of course later we found out that chargrilled oysters are a New Orleans specialty so every place we went to after we ordered them to compare. Oceanas oysters we're okay compared to the others we had. The platter was huge and enough for 3 people to share. Overall, it was a good dinning experience. It does remind me of a fast food version, or chain version, of New Orleans cooking, if that makes sense.

Stopped in for fresh oysters, and a quick drink and ended up ordering a sampling.

The server recommended the Ragin' Cajun Bloody Mary, Peppar Absolut soaked in the most delicious giardiniera. It was spicy and a great start to the meal.

For starters we tried the gator tail bites served with a remoulade sauce. They were fried just right, not greasy at all. We also sampled 6 of their ""famous oysters""; grilled oysters ""smothered with our unique zesty garlic and cream herb cajun sauce, finished with a fresh blend of parmesan and romano cheeses."" The grilled flavor of the oyster is lost under all the topping, but I was told these are a favorite. They were very tasty for sure, but i missed fresh oysters.

We split a fried shrimp po boy, served on a bed of slaw; crisp shrimp and great bread. Definitely a yes.

Our waiter was very knowledgeable and everything he recommended was phenomenal.

We started off with a few appetizers:
-Crab Cakes (2 pieces) - $12.5
-BBQ Shrimp - $8
-Seafood Gumbo(cup) - $4.75
-Oysters on half shell (1/2Doz) - $6

The crab cakes (waiter's recommendation) were DELICIOUS!!! Perfect thin crust with moist crab meat on the inside. Definitely one of the best I have ever had!!!
The BBQ Shrimp were awesome, and that sauce they were served in made one tasty dip for the bread.
I ordered the gumbo(waiter's recommendation) just to try some, but I couldn't stop eating till it was all gone. You never had gumbo, till you get some in NOLA.

For our main course we got:
-Fried sea food platter - $19 (mine)
-BBQ Ribs - $18 (friend)
-BBQ Shrimp(main dish) - $18 (friend)
-Blackened Shrimp Salad - $15 (friend)
-Oyster Rockefeller(12) - $15.50

I tried my friend's Blackened Shrimp and the seasoning was very nice.
My fried sea food platter had fried shrimp, catfish, and scallops. The catfish was really good. The batter wasn't too thick and the fish was very flavorful.
The Rockefeller oysters(waiter's recommendation) had bacon and cheese on them, and were cooked over an open flame. Extremely tasty!!

For desert we got:
-Bread Pudding - $5
-Sazerac -$8.50
-2 pitchers of Draft Amber Ale - $15/each

Bread Pudding was pretty good. A bit too sweat for me, but you guys might enjoy it.
Sazerac - Rye Whiskey with bitters and sugar. Was way too sweet! I should have just asked for the whiskey by itself.


First time we came here, the wait wasn't too bad.However, our second time we waited 20 min in line and almost 40 min. for our food.

I'd definitely check this place out again, next time I'm in town.

BLACKENED BAYOU DUCK- Smoked duck then blackened and topped with a crawfish mushroom cream sauce
This dish was very good and flavorful. It was packed with different spices and had many layers of flavors. The duck was beautifully cooked. It was tender and juicy and I absolutely love the mushroom cream sauce. It had a nice thick consistency and was so creamy.

SURF AND TURF
This dish was okay. The beef was cooked nicely and had some nice flavors, but it wasn't as flavorful as the other dish. The oyster was friend and was a bit too dry for my taste.

BANANAS FOSTER ICE CREAM CAKE- with caramel, strawberries and chocolate
I really like the moist cake and the fruity strawberries and the rich chocolate. It was a nice way to the end the meal with something cold, but sweet.

NEW ORLEANS BREAD PUDDING- with praline and rum sauce
This bread pudding was very moist and I love the rum. It had a nice sweet alcohol taste to it and tasted very nicely with the sweetness of the dessert.

I ordered the St Louis Eggs .  Supposedly Oceana Grill was using Petunia's recipes/chef or something, but there is no comparison to Petunia's dish(es).  The crab did not taste right nor did it smell right, the eggs came on a white oval dish, they looked like they were haphazardly thrown on the plate, not a garnish to be seen, and half the plate was just a stark white void.  There were hunks of a yellow cheese melted on top,  it looked awful.  The dish was unappetizing in it's appearance and taste.  I could not eat the crab.  This was my second bad experience in two days in the Quarter.   
What I did eat made my stomach act up in a relatively short time, normally I have a gut of steel

Let me state that they are open during this Covid pandemic, so kudos to them. It may also explain why things were so crazy this time.

There will be a line- something we all must deal with. Get over it now before you go.

Once seated, it took a while for our waiter to come over. It could be bc he had a large group that was giving him difficulties or bc he was new and just frazzled.

It was busy inside. Kids running around everywhere. It was pandemonium.

Food:
Chargrilled oysters- not the greatest in the city. A lot of cheese in the topping, maybe bc the oysters were not the greatest quality. 

Crab cake w mushroom sauce (can't remember its name on the menu). My first order was pretty cool once it got to the table. Then one bite in there was some item in it that was not edible... similar to dental floss.
I advised the waiter, and his response was ""okay.""  
I eventually spoke to a manager and she offer to make a new meal for me to take, to which I agreed. This order we took with us back to the hotel... still disappointed.
Crab cakes seems to be deep fried... when you receive the meal to go it is deconstructed so the sauce is separate from the crab cakes. I realize the sauce is what gives the crab cake the flavoring, bc the crab cake is somewhat bland.

Seafood platter with fried shrimp, catfish, and oysters.
Can't really go wrong with fried food- but it was not spectacular.

Line and wait to get seated. Not Oceania's fault, but adds to the list of more minor issues. 

Once we were seated, we waited a while to have our server even introduce herself. Got our drink order in and I told our server, my wife is very thirsty, can we get her a water as soon as possible?  Was told no problem. We waited a bit but my wife ended walking up to the bar to get her drink. When our server did bring waters, my wife's cup(plastic) was cracked. No one noticed initially,  but it was leaking everywhere and made quite a mess. 

Food came out in a reasonable time. However, server drops food off and never gave us any silverware. So we had to wait for her return. 

Thankfully food was good. 

However, the meal was somewhat expensive for this type of venue.  With tax, tip and one cocktail(wife only ever had water) no appetizers, the bill came out to over $80 for 2 people.  At the end of the day I did not feel this was good bang for the buck. Food was good but not $80 good. Service was definitely not $80 service.",2021-08-12 06:11:10

We visited New Orleans and Florida between Christmas to New Years.  

We arrived in New Orleans around 10pm; we called ahead on our drive in, when we were still 30-45 minutes out, and confirmed with the hotel's front desk that several restaurants would still be open, which was comforting.

We were in New Orleans, in part, to get some good Cajun on our trip.
And Oceana delivered.

The walk from the Residence Inn was short, and thankfully there was no wait, but with food this good you can see how Oceana may have waits some (many?) nights.

We strongly considered a few of the appetizers... but with limited space in the van for leftovers we decided to just order dinner and dessert.

We ordered and really enjoyed:
- blackened chicken with fries
- Two Taste of New Orleans... beans and rice and sausage, jambalaya, and etoufee

Our son loved the chicken and we really liked the beans and rice and jambalaya and LOVED the etoufee... awesome!!!  and with garlic bread... sooo good.

Then... dessert... strawberry cheesecake and chocolate mousse and creme broyles... we shared... and they were gone guickly.

So GOOD!

Thank you, Oceana!",2021-01-21 07:50:40

The Oceana's Famous Oysters had a very unique taste compared to the oysters we've tried at other restaurants.

I will return but not during an over-crowded situation. This restaurant should not be open during Mardi Gras. It is much better when the crowds aren't around. 

Service: The staff was extremely friendly from the hostess, to the bartender, to the waitress, to the busboy (bus person). The menu specifically states that the bill can not be split. However, our waitress was ready and able to split our bill into 5 separate bills. Eventually, that ended up not happening and all was paid on one bill. Her eagerness alone was enough to warrant a nice tip. She was great, even after my friend spilled her full drink on the table. She gave my friend a new one quickly, without complaint and with a smile. 

Food: Well, I guess it depends on what you order. I enjoyed my shrimp fettuccini alfredo. However, for me to be in New Orleans, I expected more seasoning than what I received. My sister ordered a trio of red beans and rice, jambalaya & crawfish etouffee. I couldn't tell the difference between the three and they are very different dishes. My friend ordered a seafood pasta jambalaya and she loved it. The catfish platter was divine! I took issue with the shrimp and grits but my friend loved hers. Lastly, the crab cakes in mushroom sauce, YES YES YES! I was in high heaven. That sauce is the best I've tasted in a WHILE! Crab cakes are crab cakes but THIS SAUCE WAS YES!

Odds & Ends: There must be something about small restrooms in restaurants that's positive to the owner. If so, lemme tell ya, it's a disservice to the patron. The women's restroom had two stalls, one sink, and the non-handicapped stall was not big enough for me, period. I had to stand completely over the toilet just to open/close the stall's door. Plus-size women, or women with thighs, BEWARE! The non-handicapped stall is NOT FOR YOU! Of course, there is no restaurant parking but that has a lot to do with how New Orleans is built as a city. Some of the tables were a lil too close together for my taste. The stairs to get to the upper levels were slender in width. You may have to let someone up/down before you can go up/down.",2020-09-06 20:21:29

I almost left, but then the alligator bites on the appetizer menu called out to me, so I ordered it.

So glad I did! I got them blackened, and they were so delicious. I was so surprised to find them to be perfectly seasoned, incredibly tender, juicy pieces of meat.  It didn't even need the accompanying sauce.

Oh, they also had a Yelp check-in deal for a discount off the total, and service was pretty friendly!

Definitely the most delicious alligator I have ever had, probably best thing I had in the French Quarter. Would definitely come back here again.",2017-03-26 00:30:20

There was a very lively crowd and the food smelled delicious. Our waitress, Erica, was simply spectacular and very polite. Something I immediately took note of. I appreciate how thoughtful she was when it came to me and my partners food delivery.. i.e. splitting up our crab cake appetizer and giving us a bowl of gumbo instead of a cup to share. When it came time to check out, I used my coupon provided from yelp and the manager took care of it with no problem. The bread pudding is to die for, very fluffy and sweet!

Oceana grill was just ""OKAY"" for me. I started with a Hurricane and a dozen oysters in the half, and they actually smelled very fishy. I ate every single one and didn't get sick, which was my primary concern as soon as they arrived at my table. The drink was bomb!
I ordered the Redfish oceana which came highly recommended by my server, but again it was just okay. The seasoning on the fish was bland, although I was very happy with the size of the filet. The amount of crawfish in the mushroom cream sauce was a bit sad. The Entrée came with a side of mash, and corn in a special gravy - the corn was the actual BEST part of the whole dish.

You pretty much get what you expect. The prices here are high but that's typical for restaurants within the area (french quarter and bourbon).

Everything else was what you expect it would taste like. Jambalaya had a very strong tomato taste to it which I enjoyed but was surprised. Gumbo had a good amount of small shrimp, not too strong as other places might have it. The etouffee had a decent amount of vegetables and crawfish. Sausage was good.

Pros: from the second you walk in you are very promptly greeted with the hospitality that you would expect. We opted to sit in the courtyard outside since the weather was less humid and sunny. We are glad we did. We were lucky enough to get an amazing server who was ever ready and prompt whenever we wanted or didn't even know we wanted something. The charbroiled oysters with Creole sauce were beyond what we expected and in hindsight should have ordered a full dozen. The seafood gumbo was outstanding and in a very large bowl with ample French bread and rice. It could be a meal in of itself. We selected to share the Blackened Redfish topped with a crab cake shrimp and a creole sauce. Everything was fantastic and delivered with utmost care and consideration. The manager even stopped by at one point to check on us and we were impressed that she was clearing tables as she did. We loved the tag team service to deliver food that came from the kitchen. What a way to help each other out.

The just ok- not a lot to say that was just okay but one thing that stood out was the shrimp on top of the Blackened Redfish. It was void of any seasoning or grill marks and did not seem to be Gulf Shrimp. It would have been even more outstanding on the fish had it been seasoned correctly and kissed the grill a few times before being added to the top of an outstanding dish.

When i saw the line i knew this place had to be good. And even though there was a line, the wait was less than 20 min. On the outside it looked small, but in reality its very spacious on the inside. 

For the appetizer we got oysters on the half shell which were very fresh tasting and gator bites which were perfectly seasoned. For the entree i was able to enjoy the Red Fish Oceana. Such a hearty serving with a great crawfish sauce that they put on the top of the fish. My dad got the Taste of NOLA which gave you a sample of everything that NOLA is known for. Both dishes were full of flavor and came out piping hot! For dessert i enjoyed the creme brulee which had the perfect sweetness.

I definitely recommend this as a place to stop if you are visiting NOLA. Service was quick and awesome.",2018-01-24 00:15:58

We held a large group dinner (~120 ppl) at this restaurant. When we arrived, there were problems with what they had promised for our group. At the end of dinner, we tried to adjust the gratuity to reflect the unhappiness with the service (ie, not accomodating our request for vegetarian options, not letting us into the room till half an hour after our reservation etc). However, the owner called the cops, saying we were not paying our bill!!!!! We tried earnestly and politely to hand over a credit card on multiple occasions; we simply wanted to adjust gratuity. The owner/manager refused and repeatedly yelled and threatened us all with arrest. The cops showed up and eventually sorted things out. I have never seen such ridiculous behavior. It was the most bizzarre, distasteful, disgusting way to treat customers I have ever experienced.

This dinner was our first dinner of our Nola trip and it was the one that left the most lasting impression. I also really liked the decor, it kinda had the look and feel of what New Orleans supposed to be. Also, if you check in on Yelp there is a 10% discount offer.

The food:

Red Fish Tchoupitoulas- Blackened Red Fish on top of a jalapeno crawfish cornbread dressing topped with sauteed shrimp in a garlic lemon butter sauce. Holy Moses was this delicious, this was a special and the flavor was amazing and I thought the jalapeno crawfish corn bread was absolute heaven. I thought the pairing of the blackened red fish to the jalapeno crawfish corn bread to the sauteed shrimp was an excellent pairing. As much as I loved this dish, the only criticism, I did find the Red Fish to be a smidge dry. This should absolutely be put on their regular menu. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=-N8xwsx-Sghxgoc_o7qGxg&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA

Crawfish Etouffée- Southern Cajun stew with steamed rice. This was the best Crawfish Etouffée of the entire trip. The Etouffée had such a dept of flavor, the texture and taste of the crawfish were superb. Highly recommend.

Seafood Gumbo- The best gumbo I had on the entire trip, yet again such a depth of flavor. So much flavor packed into such a small bowl, everything in said bowl was so delicious. Highly recommend.

Taste of New Orleans- Creole jambalaya, Crawfish Etouffée, red beans and rice with smoked sausage. This dish was kinda the best of everything dish, but overall I thought it was just OK. I didn't really care for the Jambalaya, for me the dish was too wet and had too much of sweet tomato flavor, and to me, it was overpowering. Crawfish Etouffée was bomb, of course. The red beans and rice was good but to be honest, it didn't leave much of an impression. 

Oceana's Famous Oysters- Chargrilled over an open flame, smothered with garlic and cream herb cajun sauce, finished with a fresh blend of parmesan and romano cheeses. Overall, I did like the chargrilled oysters but I thought they came off very heavy and greasy, I feel like the most I would be able to eat is 2, maybe 3 tops when I can normally finish a dozen oysters on the half shell. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=W5mVHZf8SlboM7d1q8NSKA&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA

Fresh Oysters On Half Shell- I thought the oysters on the half shell were just OK, I didn't think they had that much flavor. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=uHH5KZyKqWYdGwgOCfRuBw&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA

Gator Tail Bites- Marinated white meat gator tail served fried or blackened served with remoulade sauce. I tried this just for the pure curiosity of it and I thought both versions were just OK. I thought it was kinda like chicken, just a more expensive version of chicken. For me, between the two versions, I did prefer the fried version more. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=pTZCkSQgjhvMbP9dHiJKrQ&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA",2020-04-16 02:26:36

After a long evening clubbing we woke up the next day very hungry. After a quick swipe on Yelp! and seeing how the restaurants received so many positive reviews, it was very telling that would be an ideal option for where we want to eat. 


Upon arrival, there was a little bit of a wait but the hostess got my name and said when the whole group (10 of us) are present, we'd be seated. One of my buddy and I hung out at the bar and enjoyed glasses of Mimosas while we wait. Eventually, everyone showed and as promised, we were seated.  


Just be advised there are two stories and the upper deck is where you want to be. Downstairs seemed a bit cramped for my taste. Our server was awesome and did agreat job taking care of our large party, she even offered us separate checks making it more convenient for everyone. 

​Price wise, plates average around $10 to $17 and the menu had all my favorites including Fried Oysters which is a must have while in New Orleans.

We have tried the catfish, oyster, shrimp and combo plates.  My mother has ordered the seafood Alfredo and really enjoyed it. My favorite is the crab cake dinner. The crab cakes are huge and filled with fresh crab with little filler such as bread crumbs. The seasonings are spot on. As if they aren't flavorful enough on their own, the cakes are covered with a creamy shrimp and mushroom sauce which is out of this world. Even the greens that come with the dish are fantastic. I wish I could eat this dish all day. For appetizers, try the calamari or the bbq shrimp!",2015-03-08 22:10:02

1. Fried seafood platter (17.50$) - fried oysters, catfish, shrimp, jalapeño hush puppies, coleslaw, and comes with cocktail and tarter sauce. I mean, it's fried food, not much explaining to do but loved the catfish! Fries were also pretty good. 

2. Gumbo (9.50$)- ordered the bowl instead of cup because cup sounded like so little (6oz), both our first times having gumbo so it was an interesting experience. Soup with shrimp, rice and bread. It wasn't bad, but nothing to fan about. 

I've read through a lot of the reviews and it's a mixture of feelings but I personally feel the food isn't like amazing (or it's probably cuhs we got the fried stuff, but it was a recommended dish), but it wasn't anywhere near bad. The service was definitely up to par. Our server laquisha (apologize for the spelling), and she was super sweet. Took care of us from beginning to end!

We were out for a walk in the afternoon and popped in here for a quick bite.  This building is beautiful and the hostess and waitstaff are awesome.  

We sat on the 2nd floor and Dominique G was our server.  She brought us ice waters and menus then introduced their specials.  We ordered the BBQ Shrimp and 1/2 doz Oceana's Famous Oysters from the Appetizer section and a side of fried Crawfish.  The shrimp and crawfish came out first, the crawfish were tasty but damn, we were not ready for the deliciousness of those shrimp...!  Calling them bbq is dishonest to those shrimp.  They were delicious...!  

But then... the OYSTERS came out...

These char grilled ocean delicacies are covered with the most delicious garlic & cream herb Cajun sauce and dusted generously with Parmesan & Romano cheeses.  These oysters are the MUST HAVE if you are ever lucky enough to visit the FQ.  I only say 'lucky' because we were on a spur of the moment driving road trip from Pittsburgh, PA with very little research or planning.  

We finished all of the above and rather full but the thought of having to travel all the way back down here for more oysters forced me to order another 1/2 doz.  

These oysters were so good that when another table was sat next to us and they mentioned never being there before and ordering an appetizer- I had to lean in and suggest them.  They ordered them and fell in love, just like me.  

Thank you Oceana and staff for an awesome lunch.  And another thank you for helping me out by finding and selling me that particular 'shirt' I was interested in.  I love it...!

I'm torn. I'll start with the bad in case it's a deal breaker for readers. Halfway into our gumbo, a large (guessing 10 lb) rat dropped from the ceiling, bounced on our table and then ran off. It startled a few guests and waitstaff. The response seemed a little too much like this happens all the time. By comparison, in most restaurants if you even saw a rat the manager would come out, apologize and probably offer you a free dessert. In this one, the rat literally hit our table. Nobody came to wipe it off, no manager came and things just continued on like normal. There was actually more concerned because nobody knew where it went and the staff was a bit nervous. We weren't looking for them to comp the meal, but the way things progressed just seemed like it wasn't a big deal and they are used to it in the French Quarter. In their defense, we had a mouse problem in our hotel room, so rodents appear to be a challenge here. 

On the pro side, The food is great and our server was really sweet. I recommend the red beans and the gumbo. Oddly, I'd probably still go back. Obviously, it wasn't enough to make us storm out. But that may also be because we were a bit desensitized after living with mice for three days. I'd say the odds off this happening to you are low, but who knows.

We met up in New Orleans, she came in from California, and I came in from Tennessee. We were departing the next day for a 5 day cruise. My friend found this place and made reservations. It's right in the French Quarter. There was a line of people when we got there, but again, we had a reservation. We were taken upstairs to a table and our server came by shortly to take drink orders.

Let me say, our server was wonderful. I believe her name was Kim. She was funny, and nice and very helpful. We saw her interact with other customers as well, and she was just as engaged with them as she was with us. Awesome service!

I started out with the Mandarin Blush drink and it was really good. Refreshing and fizzy. I think I had a few of these. For an appetizer we ordered the crab cakes. They were very tasty. That crawfish and mushroom sauce was soooo good. Almost licked the plate. While not the best crab cake I've ever had, the sauce really did bring it up to a different level, instead of the usual remoulade sauce typically served with crab cakes.

Then my BFF and I shared the Taste of New Orleans and our server even had it split for us into separate plates. Nice touch! It was great to have a pretty decent sized ""sampling"" of red beans & rice, jambalaya and crawfish etouffee. We even had some fried crawfish on top of it. It was plenty for both of us and left us some room for dessert.

Did I say dessert? Sure did. We shared the New Orleans Bread Pudding with some yummy kind of praline rum sauce. Oh my! Of course, it had a scoop of vanilla ice cream on it too. The 2nd time I wanted to lick the plate at this establishment. We tried to play it cool like we weren't gluttons and left two tiny little bites left. LOL.

We even had a birthday in our party and asked the staff to sing. Lo and behold, we waited so long, we ended up just singing it ourselves.

chargrilled gator bites were seriously incredible. this was my first time trying alligator meat and i was certainly not disappointed. it was juicy and flavorful and just SO GOOD. we much preferred it to the fried bites (we got half grilled/half fried), but both were really really good. alligator is truly underrated. was also happy to hear that the alligator we were eating was not from a nearby swamp, but rather, from an alligator farm. it would have saddened me to hear that gators were being kidnapped from nearby swamps -- so good on that oceana. 

then oceana's famous oysters. oh man, these were delectable. the sauce was so rich and herbed and you can never really go wrong with chargrilled oysters.

taste of new orleans was AMAZEEEEE. the jambalaya, the crawfish etoufee, the red beans and rice ... while not that aesthetically pleasing, it was truly delightful to the tastebuds. we tried this our first night in new orleans and were so happy to get to try all the specialties and weren't disappointed with a single dish. jambalaya holds a very, very special place in my heart, and oceana's was soooo good. 

then finally, we got dessert -- bread pudding. our server said this wasn't their best dessert, but i don't see how that could be because it was UNBELIEVABLE. so so so delicious. i love bread pudding. and oceana (& the incredibly nice staff who portioned out everything out for the 2 of us without us EVEN ASKING!!!! like how nice is this? so nice. so practical. i love you oceana)",2017-01-07 22:08:07

It can seem a little clustered when you first walk in but after you are seated it is better. They have three different seating areas so this restaurant would d be great for a big crowd.

Come to find out, she was the daughter of our waitress, who was working there for the summer while she was out of school. Kudos to oceana for making this a family oriented environment. Our waitress, Megan L, was extraordinary!!! Just as good as the food! I had the special. Chicken and waffles, But it was made with huge pieces of french toast instead. Cooked perfectly! And the bloody mary was the best I ever had! We also tried the alligator. Half grill and half fried. We're still fighting over which ones better. I'm glad I tried it a second time.

The cajun spices are reduced for us tourists! My business partner and I went for early dinner on day 1. Day 2, I took my wife and sales rep for early dinner...it was that good! Day 1 we ordered BarBQ shrimp as appetizer which is in a spicy lemon garlic sauce. It came with 5 medium shrimp and 2 pieces of french bread to soak up the sauce. It was AMAZING! The only problem there was more sauce than 2 pieces of bread could absorb. Thats a good thing because the main course size was large.  I ordered Redfish Tchopotoules (spelling) blackened with crawfish sauce on top of jalapeno cornbread stuffing. It came with collard greens (best ever!!!!). Every bite was fantastic...and I ate every bite even though it was double what I would normally ate. No room for dessert. Day 2 - 2 orders of BarBQ shrimp and all 4 of us wanted more.  I ordered Red Beans and Rice and lived every bite! I would order it again everyday if I could. For dessert all 4 shared the chocolate mouse cake...AMAZING! I am not a dessert fan but that has to be in my Top 5 favorites. I suggest going early because when we left both days there was a line waiting to get in and the place is 3 stories us a patio!

Tip: MAKE A RESERVATION!! 

Around 6:30-7:00pm, the line will get LONG. We made a reservation the morning of with no problem,  and were promptly seated when we arrived. Staff was friendly and we were helped right away! 

We started with the crab cake appetizers, followed by the gumbo, and the chef special that night. The chef special sounded delicious (pictured) which I believe was a reddish with their crab cake sauce and a cornbread jalapeño mash below. 

The crab cakes were pretty good, a little too bready but for the price, crabby enough! The gumbo was outstanding! At this point in the trip, Oceana was our favorite place and our favorite gumbo. The chef special was incredibly flavorful and the fish was perfectly seasoned and cooked. 

We both had mixed drinks. My husband had a strawberry margarita, which he thought was good, for a non-tequila fan and was very boozy! I had the Tropical Storm which was DELICIOUS. Gosh I could have ten more! Very boozy, very tasty. 

Also neat: if you don't finish your drink, you can take it with out the restaurant and keep the cup as a little neat souvenir! Would definitely return when back in NOLA!",2019-09-09 04:38:33

YWjp7YJCOovodOlMwIFiNg,jfP512Pt6pjRHGw8UlyHGw,ac1AeYqs8Z4_e2X5M3if2A,5,2,0,0,"Came here as tourists on a weekday to try some New Orleans cuisine, in New Orleans! As we arrived, my friend and I were told the wait was about 15 minutes to be seated, and we waited in the entrance area, pondering what we would order so that we could maximize our tasting potential of New Orleans food. When it was time to get seated, we went upstairs and around many other tables to finally get seated. Holy crap! This place is HUGE. And they were pretty much filled to capacity! Not sure if they have two or even three floors, which are all super huge.

Louisiana crab meat cakes - I just realized when I got this dish that I've actually never had crab cakes before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. These were great! There was a nice crispiness to the outside of the cake that was very pleasant to bite into, and there was a ton of flavor in the mushroom sauce and cake itself. I'm generally not a crab meat or crawfish fan, but maybe that's just because I haven't had legit treatments of such seafood before as this dish was quite excellent!

Oceana's famous oysters - I've never really gotten into chargrilled oysters, and this dish was no different. I'm just always expecting a nice raw fleshy feeling when I sink my teeth into the meat, but instead I'm greeted with something that's already cooked, no longer possessing that fresh sensation. The flavors within this dish were incredible however, and really liked the garlicky flavor in the oils along with the parmesan cheese topping the oysters.

Taste of New Orleans - This was a wonderfully concocted plate! The trio of dishes that comprise this dish (jambalaya, etouffée, and beans w/ rice and sausage) are made to fit snuggly among each other like interlocking pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, and complement each other just as well. I don't like etoufée myself, but it was still done very nice. And I can't complain at all because my dining partner loved the etouffée, but did not enjoy the beans and rice as much, which I found to be intoxicating. There's something for everyone in this dish, making it a dish worthwhile to order for the entire table, as it has the potential to satisfy everyone somehow. The jambalaya was on point as well.

Overall, awesome food! Quick service, friendly staff, and wonderfully flavorful and thoughtfully crafted dishes. Try this place out, especially if you're a tourist (like me) and want some nice comforting New Orleans style food. Although I'm not sure how much fidelity Oceana has with what is considered ""true"" New Orleans style cuisine (truth be told, this place has a somewhat commercialized, mainstream vibe to it), not having eaten much of it. Regardless their quality of food is definitely working out for them and is super tasty.",2018-01-08 19:57:43

I came here just a few hours after having brunch at Atchafalaya and over ate there, but my friend had just rolled into town and was hungry and when she asked, ""Is this place good?"" I enthusiastically said hell yeah it's good!

And so we split the fried zucchini appetizer and the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta entree. Roll me out the door, jesus I was having trouble. Shrimp and alligator sausage with onions, bell peppers in a Creole sauce, tossed with fettuccine pasta. I'd skip the zucchini to be honest, the batter was bland and didn't hold the zucchini too well. But that pasta, rich and flavorful and silky with sauce. 

Then I came back for one last meal before leaving town like I did years ago. Ordered the same thing as last time, The Royal Omelet: alligator sausage, egetables, topped with a crawfish and mushroom cream sauce with hash browns and a biscuit. But I started with the bloody mary, and the bartender asks do I want to make it an ""Ultimate"" with shrimp and oysters and I say yeah sure. When he doesn't take my order for the entree I flag him down, cuz I have a flight to catch, and he asks if I'm sure cuz that's a lot of food. I laughed, I said it was fine, whatever seafood they were putting on that thing I could handle. 

Well....there's really not a nicer way to be proved wrong. So the thing is an appetizer, not a bloody mary, and I want one now. I want one tomorrow. There's not really a bad time to order one...except for maybe when you've been eating like this for a week and told yourself you were just going to order one thing this time. Drinks aren't supposed to count. 

It's got an entire soft shell crab on it. Just to start. Two olives for eyes, two green beans for...antennae? It's got a face. Did I mention my bloody mary has a face? Oh how she looks at me with warmth and affection. Behind her, on skewers, are 6 fried shrimp, and 6 fried oysters. And a string of  5 pearl onions and 5 peppers in case you wanted a little more to nosh on. 

I was dying. I wanted to eat so much more than I did that morning but it just wasn't possible. I don't even remember the entree. I know they slathered honey butter on the biscuit - I was so full I was delirious. I remember stumbling out of there in search of my third cup of coffee just so I could make it to the airport. 

Music was just right: Jack and Diane, Zeppelin, Jimi, Beatles, Tom Petty. 

Thanks Oceana, I love you guys.",2019-12-09 20:00:27

I get you want to make a profit but, saving money by buying frozen product from the mass restaurant supply house and trying to pass it off as quality is not the way to do it. When I spend $100 for a meal I expect quality. 

We started with a pair of crab cakes. I have had these before and they were good. Not this time. Can you say breading with a little crab meat?   The breading should hold the crab meat together, it should not be 50% of the crab cake.

On to the entrees. My Bride was on a hunt for fried shrimp, having had the shrimp last year, she ordered the fried shrimp platter and I ordered the pasta special. 

My pasta: Alfredo Sauce with blackened shrimp and crawfish that was ok at best.  The blackened crawfish and shrimp were like rubber. I would give it a solid 2.

My Bride's fried shrimp platter took the prize. The breading was so thick you could peal it off the shrimp in chunks. The breading should be light and it should not weigh more than the shrimp itself. This was frozen, prepackaged, mass marketed shrimp. To top it off the shrimp and the hush puppies were fried in old grease.

Here's why I was reluctant to pass out the one star.  Our waiter really tried to make it right. He had the cook come out who immediately apologized and offered to bring her a new one.  Within a few minutes a new platter piled high with shrimp arrived. Unfortunately you can't fix something if all you have is frozen product combined with bad grease. I really appreciated the extra effort our waiter provided.

I'm guessing there will be more one and two star reviews in the future .........",2015-12-17 22:40:36

The best dish was probably the alligator starter (blackened). On demand they can cook both styles (blackened and breaded). The blackened alligator is a must try. 4.5 stars.

Cajun jambalaya seafood pasta: way too much sauce. Noodles drenched (not to say ""swimming"") in sauce. It was nice but sauce should have been lighter. Contains lot of shrimps n seafood. 2.5 to 3 stars.

This place was in my tags, had a check-in offer and stays open late. Ratings seemed good enough... decision made. Seeing the line to get in sealed the deal. Everyone knows that if there's a line, it's worth waiting for!

When our turn came, the host walked/slid us to the table (potentially a thick coat of grease on the floor) and pointed out the restrooms as we passed. It's on the corner of Bourbon St, so, restrooms are a hot commodity - great start.

Drink order was taken right away, also ordered a crab cake app. They split the app into 2 plates for the 2 of us, fabulous, but this is where it gets complicated. Someone else's plate was placed on our table & the server walked away. She then came back, picked it up & served it - served food from our table that hadn't even remained in sight. 

About this time we were presented with the worst bloody mary of the trip, possibly the worst I've ever had. But 1 bite of crab cake and all was forgiven. They were excellent, possibly the best I've ever had. Drinks + Apps = a wash.

Entrees were good - my husband's (blackened) better than mine (redfish). If I had to guess, I'd guess the greens were canned. I find mashed potatoes an odd fish accompaniment, texturally. 

The crab cakes were the standout & blackened fish the runner up. The bloody mary, a disaster.

They needed a reminder to adjust the bill for the check-in offer, but gladly did so. Service was good, especially for being so busy. We were checked on regularly and offered refills. Water was presented without asking. Before departing, we were reminded about the restrooms.

We came here for a super late dinner before going out to Bourbon for the night, so this location was perfect for our plans. We had also dropped by Frenchmen St right before and had a couple of drinks so none of us realized how hungry we were until the food came and we DEVOURED it. People are lined up outside the door and theres a small bench inside meant for one or two groups to sit down and wait to be seated. When we saw the line, we were about to leave, but the hostess reassured us that the wait was only about 5-10 minutes. 

Thank goodness we didn't choose to go somewhere else before asking, because the food here did not disappoint! We were seated within 10 minutes just like the hostess said and of course I jumped right on Yelp to look at pictures of what to order. You also receive a sweet 10% discount for checking in! Our table shared the alligator appetizer, fries with a crawfish sauce poured on top, jambalaya pasta, and trio sampler with gumbo, jambalaya, and etouffee. 5 stars all around. We sat in silence for a solid 15 minutes chowing down and by the next time our waitress strolled around we had licked the plates clean.

I was craving for char-grilled oysters, and was happy to hear they were serving them. Of course we also ordered breakfast dish, which was the crawfish omelette with hashbrowns & biscuit. 

Let me start with the crawfish omelette, since it was served first. The chunks of crawfish sticking out of the omelette made it obvious the restuarant doesn't not skimp on ingredients- or portions. Super yummy breakfast I'd eat for dinner.....but then I also eat oysters for breakfast. 

Next came the dozen char-grilled oysters covered in some type of cajun sauce. Not bad, but I felt it was just a tad on the salty side.

For food we ordered the Fried Alligator Tail , Shrimp Creole, and the Taste of New Orleans.

I wasn't a huge fan of the Shrimp Creole, it is a tomato based dish and it didn't have much spice to it. The Taste of New Orleans was great and I would order it again if we ever go back.   It's a sampler that includes the Creole Jambalya, Crawfish étouffée and Red Beans & Rice.

Luckily we were walking by earlier and, SCORE!, no line at all! So we moseyed on in and decided that we just wanted to sample a few different things so we ordered the combo platter. We opted for the fried seafood platter ($22.99 I believe. Definitely not the 17.50 it says on their website lol) plus a Diet Coke and a water. With taxes, our tab came to $28.

The combo platter was very tasty and had both of us filled and satisfied at the end! I personally am not big on the oysters, but loved the shrimp and the catfish!

Saturday night we wanted to focus on menu items that we loved during from our first meal. 3 items were missing. One for myself seafood fried dish, bbq shrimp for my mom and a grill oyster. Mom didn't had her bbq shrimp and the adult only had 1 doz of grill oyster both were charged, They did removed my fried seafood cause I guess he didn't want to call me a lair.  Now a side note we had 9 adults and 3 children and 7 of us are in the food industry either owners and manager, so we know it can be difficult. The 2 stars was for manager that came and didn't say a word and the server who made up that he brought the food when most of the apps and half the oyster was brought out by either the chef, Boh manager or runner.

If there is one thing I despise is shortcutting quality especially if I'm paying for it.

The restaurant definitely had a cool and casual nautical theme to it. We were seated within 10 minutes which was nice considering how crowded it seemed inside. 

Of course, the menu mostly offered seafood dishes and usual NOLA eats like jambalaya and po'boys. We had the crawfish etouffee plate, which was good but not better than other dishes we have had in the city. It had a good amount of crawfish, but flavors were a little bland. We thought about ordering more, but honestly after this plate, we came to the conclusion that the best food is outside of the French Quarter so we didn't bother.

Overall, I do think it is a good restaurant to visit if you want to stay within the French Quarter; the menu is extensive and the restaurant is a nice place to either have a nice dinner date or have a fun group dinner (we saw at least 3 bachelor/bachelorette party groups the time we went).

Definitely some chill casual NOLA vibes with bright red paint mixed with brick walls, neon signs, and all sorts of accouterments decorating the walls..even a couple big fish. We were able to snag a table for two right away and I was excited to find out they not only knew what gluten was, but they even had a dedicated gf menu. Now, to be fair, there wasn't much on this menu, but it was a menu nonetheless!

I went for the gluten free crab cakes which had an awesome remoulade and were served with collard greens and potatoes.

Order:
Louisiana Crab meat cake- It's must. They give you 2 large pieces of crab cakes with crawfish and cream sauce smothered on top. It was delicious. I recommend sharing.

Fried Catfish Po'Boy- Huge sandwich. Fried catfish pieces on 2 large pieces of french bread with coleslaw and fries. It was ok to me. 

Cajun jambalaya pasta- This order never came out. I was quite disappointed because I really wanted to eat it. But I was already full off of the Po'boy and the crab meat cake. So we told them to cancel the order if they didn't start cooking it already.

The place is huge inside so even if you have to wait in line it doesn't usually take to long. And, if it does just pop into the bar next door and grab a to-go drink while you're waiting. There are 2 seating areas downstairs + an outdoor patio and 2 areas upstairs. 

We almost always get the same thing - blackened ahi tuna. The portion size is large and fills you up for sure. We usually swap out the sides for mashed potatoes since theirs are really good.

Try their mixed drinks. They are not the crappy ""margaritas"" that everyone else is selling. These are genuine mixed drinks made by real bartenders, not colored sugar water with cheap liquor. 

Try their Oceana's Famous Oysters. This is similar to Acme, but better and less expensive. 

The service is top notch, too. Their waiters have a contest to see who gets the best Yelp reviews. Unfortunately for my server, I forgot her name (sorry)!

I was having a fabulous trip in the Big Easy so decided to save Oceana for the last meal since I heard it being recommended and there was a huge line every night when I walked by. How could it be bad, right? However, it was the worst meal I had in NOLA. I later found out that these guys were on Gordon Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares. I really wish I had watched that episode first, it would've saved by stomach. It shows them using FROZEN and spoiled food and dead rats in the kitchen. 

We got the oysters and they were extremely mushy and indeed previously frozen. When I told the manager this, he accused me of not knowing anything about oysters! I had been eating oysters in NOLA every night and these were by far the worst. I had to argue with him to get them taken off the bill actually. Also ordered the redfish and crawfish etoufee which also tasted frozen and bland!

Fast forward the main dish I ordered The taste of New Orleans which included jambalaya, crawfish Étouffée, red beans and rice with andouille sausage. SMH the jambalaya tasted like Spanish rice with a hint of sweetness. The crawfish etouffee should have been named sautéed veggies over rice because it didn't have crawfish in it I think I might've found 2 or 3 crawfish tails in my little bowl, the red beans and rice with audouille sausage was probably the best out of everything tbh. My husband ordered the mardi gras pasta just thumbs down and imma keep it that way!

COVID 19 PRECAUTIONS: This was very safely executed! There is a waiting list that is practicing social distance and they only take in one group in at a time.
The tables are spaced out comfortably and there are multiple floors to be seated on. I suggest the window view, its fun to people watch in the streets doing foolish things. Mask are required to be wore inside and going to the restroom. You can take them off at your table.

Food (***** out of *****); The oysters were magnificent! Be sure to try the Oceana's Famous Oysters. These were big char grilled oysters with a creamy, garlic, herb and parmesan sauce. These were bigger than those sold at Mr. Ed's Oyster House. The same oyster dish here also costs $1 less than at Mr. Ed's. The crab cakes were huge and full of meaty, tasty crab. The Tropical Storm was a very tasty alcoholic drink that was not too sweet. It was fruity and moderately strong. I loved it so much, that I bought another one later that night to drink in my hotel room. Since there is no open container law in Louisiana, I was able to buy a drink and walk to my hotel with a drink in my hand. They even let me keep the fancy cup as long as I bought a ""double"", which costs $5 extra for a drink with twice the alcohol. 

Service (***** out of *****); Service was friendly and quick. Canesha, my server was cheerful and even offered advice on where to go for the best music shows that evening. 

Atmosphere (**** out of *****); Chill and casual dining. I did not spot any privacy booths, though. This place is huge so you don't need a reservation for breakfast and lunch. There will always be a table available, unless it's dinner time. It's usually packed for dinner. You'll need to go to their website to make a reservation for dinner. 

Conclusion (***** out of *****); This is a great place to dine. It is very convenient as it is right there on Bourbon Street. Also, it is a very good value. If you buy a $50 gift certificate, you'll get $10 extra in gift certificates. The gift certificates cannot be used the same day. So, you'll have to come back the next day to dine again in order to use the gift certificate. Also, if you check in on Yelp, you'll get 10% off! Yay!!!! Seriously, run, don't walk to Oceana Grill!",2018-10-29 02:38:10

As soon as our waiter told us what the specials were, I didn't have to look at the menu any more. We also got a hurricane. A double and it was pretty strong. What was great here was that this was real fruit juice and not syrup.

Main course was called Redfish Vieux Carre. A big piece of blackened redfish with sautéed shrimp and a crab cake, all topped with a tasty sauce. It was absurdly delicious. I polished the plate.

Yes, this time we're having dessert. Their famous bread pudding which has a sweet praline and rum sauce. It was excellent.

Not cheap but inexpensive and very good. I would definitely come back to this one.

Tip: Make a reservation. You won't get in on time but you'll definitely have a shorter wait.

To start, the sweet tea was spot on; not too sweet and not bitter at all. For appetizers we had the alligator tail, both fried and blackened. While both were amazing, everyone agreed the blackened gator tail won out both on flavor and tenderness hands down.  The oysters..... oh the oysters!   Being from the Midwest I've been dreaming of FRESH gulf oysters and these did not disappoint.  Shucked with great skill, there were no shell fragments to be found, served ice-cold on the half shell, these little succulent bites took me to my happy place!  Probably the best I can recall eating.  

The entrees each brought their own magic to the table.  Clean and distinct flavors of authentic goodness with each dish staying in its own lane while complimenting the next perfectly. The crab cakes were fluffy and well seasoned,  bursting with huge chucks of fresh crab meat.  Lightly fried to that perfect light  crispiness on the exterior with a fluffy cloud interior. The crawfish Etouffee was on point and maybe my favorite of all we sampled, but honestly hard to pick a winner with so many good eats!   The Red beans and rice were well seasoned, creamy, and exactly all they should be, as was the jambalaya.  There literally wasn't a dish we didn't rave about.  

On to dessert. We decided to split the bread pudding and the strawberry cheesecake- which is made by a local baker nearby.  While both were solid, I think we all agreed the creamy, decadent cheesecake with the brightness of the strawberry topping won out on that challenge.  

The service was absolutely spectacular.  It wasn't lost on anyone that 100% of the staff we engaged-even those holding huge trays of food up over their heads for another table-welcomed us warmly or thanked us for coming in.  Table service was awesome with our waitress always there yet never there... if you know what I mean.  I think she filled my tea at least 10 times but never interrupted the dining experience.  Amazing.

After looking at reviews we decided to try Oceana. We walked in and were seated immediately for dinner on a Friday night.  (goes to show how dead NOLA was during our stay. 

Staff was very friendly and helpful, they wore masks and gloves, of course we had to wear masks walking in. We were served very timely and did not have to ask for anything.

There were more people inside than I had expected but we were still pretty well distanced.

We had gumbo, gator bites, redfish (another burger for the kid who doesn't like fish) and Caesar salad.

I was all tasty - I have not had gator prepared this way, the pieces were much larger and had a little spice to them along with the remoulade sauce that came with them. I could have made a meal out of that alone. The redfish oceana was also very good.  Best redfish I have had in a while. The one who ordered the burger did like it so kids can eat here.  He did eat a lot of the gator tail though.

We ordered vegetarian stew, fish and another dish but the order didn't arrive for another hour when the server informed there was an issue with the order and she is addressing it. Another 15 mins go by and nothing is still served and the manager stops by to say she is assisting to expedite our order but there was some issue in the kitchen and offers a complimentary bread pudding for desserts. I asked my server if there is anything on the menu that can immediately be served while we wait for other order and she immediately says Gumbo. And it also makes sense because you'd think it should be already prepared and ready to serve. But then she informs that even gumbo is going to take 15 mins. Finally after 90 mins of ordering we received the food. 

The stew wasn't honestly a stew at all. You'd hope a stew is slow cooked for couple hours on the stove, but the stew here seemed more of marinara sauce with Cajun spices and fresh veggies. You could say that because the veggies were as crisp as just tossed into the sauce (not stew). My friends who ordered the fish and other things liked the food though. 

At the end the server comes around again and brings the check and asks if we 'really' want the complimentary pudding. I don't understand if you aren't sure about offering you shouldn't have offered. I wouldn't recommend this place if you are on short time or have vegetarians in your party.

The line was managed very actively and very professionally considering the chaos and obviously hammered patrons. We were seated outside in the center courtyard and were attended to very well by Zach, our server. Zach was very also a very helpful guide with info on NOLA!  Nice touch.

We ordered a number of items for the three of us to sample, the fried palter, the redfish, and the NOLA sampler.  They were all just ok.  Nothing of anything stood out as particularly note worth, certainly, nothing stood out as very ""cajun"" as it was all incredibly mild and had none of the note-worthy flavors of NOLA we were hoping to experience. It was hot, seemed fresh enough, and came quickly.  That's about it... It was not bad, but it definitely was not a standout experience either.  It was an ok experience and makes sense that it was so easy to get into versus some of the other establishments that had huge lines.

When we initially arrived, there was a very long line. We were told there was a little over an hour wait. My sister went to talk to some of the waitstaff and advised them we were celebrating her birthday and some kind of way, she was able to get us in right away. 

We sat at the bar and the bartenders were so nice. I already knew I wanted the Taste of New Orleans. It consisted of crawfish etoufee, jambalaya, and red beans and rice with a side of French bread. I've only had red beans and rice as a child and their red beans were nothing like it. Everything else was new to my palette. 

When the plate came out, I was a bit skeptical because they put everything in the same bowl. I was told they were out of bowls, but that shouldn't compromise the taste. They were correct! 

The food was a burst of flavor! It was literally a party in my mouth! This food was definitely made with love. It was unlike anything I've ever tasted! I've never had jambalaya or crawfish! The sausage that came with beans had a light char on it. I took my time savoring every scoop. I wish I would've ordered one to go.

The food was superb; perfectly seared tuna stuffed with crab meat for me, a perfectly breaded and fried catfish platter for my son. We shared an appetizer of crab cakes; again, the execution was perfect, and they were so large that they could have served as an entree on their own. 

Our server was a gentleman named David; this man has mastered the art of being right on time and ensuring that everything is taken care of, and does so without ever hovering. (And he stays busy -- that timing is difficult to achieve.) He explained the various specials and recommendations smoothly and naturally; so well in fact that I never even bothered to do much more than glance at the menu. His professionalism, warmth and genuine smile alone is worth 5 stars. Combined with everything else, well, it was a wonderful dining experience overall. I return home to NOLA a few times a year, and this is a favorite stop. 

Trust me, you will not be disappointed here if you're seeking great food and a great atmosphere.",2014-04-28 13:12:49

There was a wait to sit that went out the door. No wait as we passed the line and sat at the bar which is full service.

We ordered Chef Specials Grilled Ahi Tuna ""la Boheme"" (asked for them to have the Ahi Tuna blackened) and ordered the Redfish Oceana. Ahi Tuna was good!

My mom ordered a glass of wine. When she got it, there was lipstick on the rim and crumbs in the wine. Gross. She also ordered the ribs, which were ""fall off the bone tender."" NOT. It was like rubber.

I ordered the pasta because I wasn't feeling daring and figured it had to be really hard to mess pasta up. I didn't finish my dish. Pasta was mushy and was drowning in butter. I don't remember what my friend's husband ordered. Some fish dish and he was not impressed.

Its right off Bourbon street so pretty easy to find. There was a moderate size line but it moved pretty quick as the restaurant is deceptively big! 

We ordered the half and half alligator bites, grilled clams for the table and I had the cajun pasta for myself, as well as a round of Hurricanes

The service was a bit slow but the food came out all delicious. The both of the gator bites were delicious but I absolutely loved the blacked half! Pack with tons of cajun flavor and cooked to perfect, this was probably my favorite part of the meal. The fried were good as well but I loved the cajun seasoning. 

The oysters were great, fresh, full of flavor and the char taste came through as well. 

I was most excited for the cajun pasta but it just missed the mark. It was done well with a great potion size but just needed more of a cajun kick as it was more on the creamier, alfredo side.

We were in New Orleans on a Sunday evening (cruise was next day).  Went walking up Bourbon, looking at restaurants.  Many were 1/4 full or less (it was a Sunday night after all).  But this one was mostly full.  Always a good sign.

Had Justin as our server.  Excellent service.  Very attentive, but not overbearing.  One of our entrees was cold when it was brought to the table, Justin immediately took it back, and had a new one made.  Mistakes happen, it is how you handle them that makes the difference, and Justin handled it perfectly.  Of course this also speaks for the restaurant as a whole, that servers are allowed to make such a decision.  Great all around.

The food was excellent.  Had the Taste of New Orleans, and crab cakes between the two of us.  Both were excellent.  Also had the alligator bites for appetizer, also excellent, and not just one or two tiny pieces (like so many places do), but an actual decent amount.  The alligator bites would actually be enough for a small meal if one was not very hungry.

Only negative - hot sauce.  They had a couple of standards on the table, and Justin said he could have gotten Tabasco,  but none of those are very hot.   I suggest that the restaurant get some real hot sauces (this is New Orleans right???).",2022-01-16 17:49:48

The Barbecued shrimp are in a light tangy sauce and the shrimp size were huge. They had good flavor. The crab cakes were delicious! A nice portion and served with a cream sauce. All the food had good flavor, but it came out lukewarm which was disappointing.

The ambiance: The entrance threw us a bit, because it basically looks like a bar. The dining rooms are off to the side and upstairs. Steep, narrow stairways. Basic restaurant.  No major frills or anything. 

The service: Our server took about 10 minutes to come, and seemed very flustered. We weren't informed of any specials, though we found out about them by default. We each ordered dr pepper to drink, our server disappeared for another 10 minutes or so. When he came back he didn't have any drinks. We asked what was up. With a confused look he said they were out of cups and he was waiting for some from downstairs.  Mind you, the tables next to and across from us had just received drinks...in cups. We ordered, after I inquired about the specials. My boyfriend got the fried shrimp platter. The nightly special was a shrimp and crawfish pasta, so I got it. Mistake.....

The food/drink: After 20+ minutes with no drinks our server appears with 2 sprites. We ordered dr pepper. He apologized and brought what he said was dr pepper....it was barqs root beer. We ended up asking for water. 
Our food arrived, BF had hot shrimp and cold fries and hush puppies. My pasta looked sad. Like olive garden at the end of the night sad. I'm talking overcooked, mushy fettuccine, pale red sauce, 8 shrimp and a few crawfish tails. I took one bite and spit it out. The crawfish were rubbery and super fishy. 
When our server reappeared I told him about the crawfish.  Before I could finish he walked off. His manager came over a few minutes later.  He said ""have you ever had crawfish? They are very pungent."" Sir, they are not! They devil is a lie! I LOVE CRAWFISH. And have eaten them so many times I could turn into one. Pungent is never a word I would use to describe them. He leaves, comes back and says ""I figured out what's wrong.  Crawfish don't really go well in this sauce, it enhanced to fishy flavor."" I'm sorry, WHAT?! This is YOUR SPECIAL DISH! Nah bruh, I call B.S.!

This popped up on my search and being a pescatarian, I was ecstatic. It surprisingly wasn't crowded and I got seated relatively quickly. The service was incredible and my server was such a sweetheart. Checked in often and was really warm and welcoming (got that southern hospitality immediately upon arrival to Louisiana). I ordered the shrimp platter and it came out really fast. The portion is VERY generous and I got through 3/4 of it. I was a little underwhelmed by the flavor because it basically tasted like frozen shrimp and fries I get at the local market and defrost. It wasn't bad (minus the tartar sauce which did taste funny/old) but it wasn't something phenomenal. The hush puppies were actually pretty good--had a kick to them. All in all, a decent spot to visit for a quick bite. My tour guide recommended it to our group a few days later and suggested the blackened rockfish and had I stayed longer I would've gone back and tried it because it was a nice spot.

The restaurant is narrow, but has multiple floors and multiple dining rooms. Both times we visited , we were seated in the 2nd floor which has good views. The decor is casual and colorful. The servers are very informative. They want you to be happy with your meal and have fun if you're visiting the area.

The food is that typical Louisiana cuisine. Po boys, seafood and rice, seafood and pasta. Seafood, seafood, seafood . They have a extensive bar menu as well, to-go cups available upon request.

The crab cakes were more bread-like than I would have preferred, but they are served with a crawfish cream sauce that was really delicious. They did the collard greens RIGHT, so I very much enjoyed that. The mashed potatoes are from red skin potatoes and are creamy and good; perfect for sopping up that crawfish cream sauce.

My second visit was a pre-drinking visit, so I had the fried catfish Po Boy, which comes with lettuce, slaw, tomato, remoulade, pickles and red onion . Delicious. The French fries were also fried a little harder than McDonalds' fast food chains fries and sprinkled with a little seasoning that reminds me of Season All.

It also came with a side of jambalaya and veggies. Everything was delicious! My friend ordered the blackened chicken and was equally thrilled. For dessert we had the bananas foster ice cream cake.

We were passing though on a cross country road-trip and stopped to try some of New Orleans famous seafood. I myself LOVE seafood but since a recent shrimp allergy I'm forced to try other things. I tried the blackened redfish topped with crawfish étouffée while my boyfriend just had a simple steak. The redfish dish was to DIE for and was seasoned to perfection! The portions are a tad bigger than necessary but if your appetite is huge- then you would love this! My boyfriends dinner was supposed to be cooked medium but the meat came out more medium well which was a bit tougher then we like it to be- still had great flavor and the sides were great. 

Service was great. Drinks were good! We had this drink that came out smoking which was a cool dry ice effect.

""Discounts""...Yes, it's very important to stretch your dollars while traveling. We were offered both the breakfast & lunch menu. 

I Luv me some Breakfast but I wanted to try the Jambalaya on the lunch menu. Our server was great! He filled us in on Maw Maw's Cajun Breakfast, not on the menu. It's Jambalaya with scrambled eggs mixed in with a side of biscuits. Big enough to feed two people! He had the kitchen staff split our plate for us, free of charge! It had a generous amount of shrimps. We both enjoyed our meals with the Louisiana hot sauces that was available for us.

When you step foot in the NOLA!

My friends and I stayed at the royal sonesta which is directly across the street from this bomb ass restaurant.

We didn't really pay attention to the restaurants surrounding our hotel we assumed they were too commercial. 

How wrong were we! Our last night we were searching for a dope po boy to finalize our trip. We were told to go to Pat O Briens but they however do not sell po boys on their daily menu..

The lady there directed us to oceana for a po boy expletive to remember. 

Now the NoLa period had provided awesome food from the first day.
 I was insanely surprised how wonderful everything taste in the big easy seriously it's insane.

So I ordered the alligator bites as I see alligator is pretty much on the menu in nearly every restaurants so it had to be good I said to myself.

And self was right! Taste like chicken! Good flavorful chicken.

I ordered the blackened catfish po boy with everything on it .. Lawd if you could taste a unicorn I'm pretty sure that would be it. So flavorful so amazing everything just worked together so well I almost cried.

The service was wonderful thank you Allan.

Please go and fall in love at oceana and forever be changed by the Nola and their awesome restaurants.",2014-07-15 02:16:37

Even if it becomes later known to be not real or authentic, it was very good to us. The building is pretty cool. Gave me a sense of being in college and going to the bar. I suspect prepandemic that this place probably was/is a lot of fun. 

We started off with the Cajun fries and added the crocodile. Crocodile is a happy surprise! Texture is good, and the Cajun seasoning made those little bomb bites delicious. The sauce on the fries was super rich, but in a good way. We probably could have had it as a meal and been full. 

I ordered the red beans and rice. It is a very flavorful dish. My daughter got the jambalaya Cajun pasta. That was also fire. My other daughter blackened catfish. Both plates consumed by kids, and if kids like it that means it tastes good. The wife chose the crocodile PoBoy. I mean each bite is like a flavor explosion in your mouth.

My FRIEND however, who is a vegetarian, noticed that some vegetarian options she saw on the website weren't on the physical menu once inside Oceana. When she asked the waitress about this, she said even though it wasn't on the physical menu, she could still order. So she got the spinach ravioli and let me tell you how jealous I was.

When the waitress placed her bowl on the table, the smell instantly captivated me. The presentation was on point. This meatless ravioli looked like something out of a five-star Michelin-rated restaurant. I tried it myself and was blown away. I LOVE me some meat and seafood but if I could have snapped my fingers and traded in my catfish for her damn spinach ravioli, I would have. The herbs and spices, the freshness of the spinach, the SAUCE. My friend even commented ""seems a bit garlicky,"" BUT I LOVE GARLIC so this just made it even more appealing to me!

Me: I have a 10% off coupon for checking in on Yelp. (And I showed her my phone and she read that it said that)
Her: Oh, you have to print that put
Me: Uhh, it doesn't say that at all, and how do you expect me to print something while I'm seated in a restaurant 
Her: I know, it doesn't make sense, but we've been getting lots of those, and the Manager said it must be printed
Me: It doesn't say any of what you just said; it says to show you
Her: I know, I'm sorry

I let it go. 10% isn't much, but still, why false advertise?  That set the mood for the rest of the dinner.  Waitress disappeared for lengthy periods of time. They brought the wrong order, COLD, to one of my party members.  Oh, we were a party of 6. They brought 1 dish out, 15 mins before everyone else's (it wasn't an appetizer). When they brought the rest, they forgot 1 entire dish. Another 10-minute wait for that. Then 5 mins later they bring me my dish...again.  I told the guy (which wasn't my waitress) he might as well leave it since it was made, just don't charge me, this earned a laugh. I got the catfish platter. I kid you not, there was nothing ""flaky"" or ""fried"" about it.  What I got was soggy breaded pieces of fish. I'm sure it had been sitting under the heat lamp for some time. We asked for more tarter sauce. It took, literally 10 minutes to get it. We saw the waitress pass by, and she said, and I quote, ""They had to go up to the freezer to get it. It should be here soon.""  You get the idea.  Fast forward, check time. Party of 6, split in 2, guess what?  You can guess,  wrong dishes on the check, stuff we didn't even order on the check.

I cannot understand how people think this food is good!! It's just covered in sauce, no spice, lacking taste! We got crab cakes for appetizers which were doused in gravy (1/5). I got the special fettuccini alfredo with shrimp/lobster which was so bland (1/5) and once again a whole lot of alfredo sauce. My husband got the grilled red snapper which came with a side of beans - this one was enjoyable (3.5/5). For dessert, we got pecan pie. Now I looove pecan pie, but this was mushy including the crust.

A nola native told us that most French quarter restaurants just have hype. Oceana wins that award.",2019-12-15 22:02:22

They have an extensive menu of many creole and cajun favorites, but it was no contest for me, from the moment the tour guide mentioned his favorite dish, the blackened redfish etouffee I knew that was the dish for me.    Wow!  This dish was spicy and flavorful, a perfect combination of the spicy blackened redfish and the creamy crawfish etouffee.  

It also came with jambalaya which was also packed with flavor and was very tasty.  The sauteed mustard greens were surprisingly enjoyable as well.  I only didn't finish them because I was stuffed and of all of the parts of the meal was the least impressive, but don't let that fool you, they were a great veggie side! 

The place has a great vibe, and like many spots in New Orleans, a hidden outdoor patio in the courtyard inside.  While the weather was nice enough for us to enjoy the outdoors, their busyness did not allow for it on this trip.  We went on a weekend at lunch, and there was a decent line to get in and get a table so plan accordingly especially if you are a bigger group.  

The staff was super friendly and personable.  We were in town for the Bills game and were still wearing our Bills gear after a fun win on Thanskgiving, the staff were happy to chat about the Bills and the game in a fun and friendly way.

Hostess - Amazingly wonderful! She was super accommodating and sweet and made sure we were seated comfortably.

Service - Our waiter Damon was so sweet and hardworking and made my friend's birthday lunch there extra special with his gift and bday serenade. He should be made a permanent waiter there, STAT! Josh, the bartender, also made the drinks strong but very tasty. 

Food - My goodness... The food was sensationallllllllllllllllllllll! All those L's were necessary because it was THAT delightful! The crab cakes were delectable. The creamy sauce it came with was perfection. The alligator bites were also wonderful and an awesome way to start the meal. For my entree, I got the St. Francis crepes that consisted of crawfish, veggies, and an amazing sauce. Even when I warmed up the leftovers the next day they tasted divine. The birthday bread pudding that was brought out also a SUPERB dessert. The rum sauce on it was so tastyyyy.

We started off with Barbecue Shrimp, Fried Gator Bites & Crab cakes for Appetizers. Each appetizer was so good, we used the Barbecue Shrimp sauce to dip the Fried Gator in it (If you are adventurous, try it, you won't regret it!)

When I think about this place and the food I had, it makes my mouth water (no lie). This place is one of the top ten restaurants for everyday dining and I can see why. Service was excellent (shout-out to DeMarcus who was on top of everything and helped us pick out our main dish to eat)! 

We had to wait for seating for about five minutes but no big deal at all. Service was great and where we sat was away from the main entrance so it wasn't very noisy. 

My husband and I decided to share a meal (and I'm glad we did because we couldn't have finished our meal individually) and ordered the Redfish Oceana (although, I don't think that's what it's really called but the main dish was redfish). 

When you take that first bite, it melts in your mouth. The actual fish was tender and moist- very flavorful and paired very well with the cream sauce that was smothered on top with fried and regular crawfish. The corn on the side was so good- not watered down or the knock off version of corn you get from the store. It was flavored so well and it left me wanting more.

My daughter ordered shrimp pasta and was brought chicken pasta which she sent back. The chicken pasta was chicken fingers cut up in strips and placed in pasta. Our waiter offered to replace it with the correct item and my daughter declined. 

My charbroiled oysters were cold. They tasted like the oysters were raw, they placed the topping in the microwave and then put them on top of the oysters. 

My sausage in the Taste of New Orleans was good but they could've kept the rest of it. 

My little one enjoyed her chicken fingers and fries. 

Throughout our meal the waiter came back and checked on us. I hardly touch the oysters and only ate the sausage from the taste of New Orleans. With each item I gave back he became concerned and offered to replace the items which we declined. He went to get the manager. 

Manger came over and was defensive. He asked what the problem was and let him know we didn't like the food. His response was what would you like for me to do with all this food. I was in disbelief. I responded I didn't ask for you to come to the table. Our waiter was trying to make our visit right. I didn't ask u to comp anything on our check. He replied I'll try and discount something. 

They actually wanted me to pay for the chicken pasta that should've been shrimp pasta. The manger discount was taking off the chicken pasta. He didn't honor the Yelp 10% discount offer for checking in. He said he couldn't offer any more discount than he already has.

Djn9qFjS8fG_liR2aSNuKg,Ariwz06at3CtbWZM-gPMAg,ac1AeYqs8Z4_e2X5M3if2A,3,9,10,6,"2.6 stars, no more; I have rounded it up to 3 Yelp stars, per the rules of basic arithmetic. This restaurant could have earned 4 stars, but for the obnoxious behavior of two male bartenders regarding solicitation of good Yelp reviews that I will detail later below.

This restaurant has a good menu, and particularly lots of seafood and related dishes, but it also offers a number of classic staple American foods, including hamburgers. 

Across several recent stays in the French Quarter, I have eaten dinner at this restaurant twice. Since the tables in the seating area were always filling fast (it was always at or near dinnertime on each occasion), I chose each time to sit at the bar, even though I do not drink alcohol (I know... what an anomaly for a visitor to the French Quarter!). 

The menu selection was good, the food was quite good (I ordered an appetizer and a dinner selection during each visit), and, despite the fact that the restaurant was often filling with dinner customers rapidly, the food was nonetheless delivered within a reasonable amount of time.

BTW, I have never sat, nor eaten, at a table in any of the dining rooms, and thus I cannot comment on table service. 
 
And now it is time to be really frank and blunt: The reality is that I would, under ordinary circumstances, have been tempted to give this restaurant 4 stars, but I can, in all honesty, give them only 2.6 stars at best due to certain behaviors of two male bartenders (I never had this experience with any of the female bartenders who served me) in relation to their attemtps to solicit good Yelp reviews on each of my visits; I will detail those offensive behaviors below.

During each of my two visits to this eaterie, when I sat at the bar, the bar was staffed by at least two or three bartenders, and, during the course each meal, I always received service from at least two of the bartenders, each time from one female and one male. During each of these visits, at the end of my meal, as I was reviewing my bill and paying, the male bartender (a different one each time) grabbed an oversized business card and handed it to me, telling me that it contained a link to the restaurant's Yelp review page, and asking me to leave them a good review (UGH, UGH, UGH....!). 

Each of these two male bartenders then told me their names very clearly, and told me that it would be very good if I would mention them by name (MORE UGHS!). Gratifyingly, each time that each of the offensive male bartenders mouthed these obnoxious words, I noticed the nearby female bartender in attendance (who had also served me during the course of my meal) roll her eyes to the ceiling in acute embarrassment! 

So, the bottom line is that two of the male bartenders tried WAY TOO HARD to try to get customers to leave good Yelp reviews (better never to ask for a good Yelp review at all...) for the restaurant, and were thoroughly obnoxious in trying to get me to mention their names in said review. TOTALLY OBNOXIOUS! Thankfully, neither of the two female bartenders with whom I interacted during my two meals at the bar ever tried any of these offensive shenanigans. 

So, potentially 4 stars, but degraded to 2.6 stars because some of the male bartenders try way too hard in relation to soliciting good Yelp reviews!",2015-05-30 12:02:15
UzRlGBmEOB9QJFCCWoCN1g,bQG-CTpR59NCUdKqZn1zHQ,ac1AeYqs8Z4_e2X5M3if2A,5,0,0,0,"We chose Oceana Grill at first because it was one of the few restaurants open after 10 PM on a weekday but ended up coming back another time. We ordered to-go both times, and our food was always ready fast and packaged well to avoid any leakage during transportation. 

Thoughts on the following:
- Barbecued Shrimp ($25): The BBQ shrimp is a NOLA classic you have to try, though I would say the name is a bit misleading. It didn't taste anything like traditional barbecue. Instead, it had more of an alcoholic/ cooking wine taste to it. It also was buttery, and tangy. I really enjoyed the shrimp.

- Cajun Jambalaya Pasta ($23): This was absolutely life-changing and hands down the best pasta I've ever had. The flavor of this pasta was so unique and it's something I had never tasted before. The fettuccine pasta was tossed in a creamy creole sauce and had bits of alligator and shrimp in it. It was colorful, well-seasoned, and just flawless. Though creamy and flavorful, the pasta didn't feel too heavy. I feel like people don't think about ordering pasta in New Orleans, or at least I certainly did not, but you have to give this a try. 

- Crawfish Etouffée ($18): the etouffee is a stew with a ball of rice in it and it's topped with bits of crawfish. Winter is not crawfish season, so I was glad to try a bit through the etouffee. Again, the seasoning for anything cajun is just so on point. 

- Fried Soft Shell Crab ($8): Gotta have crabs when you're in New Orleans but I actually struggled to find places with fried soft shell crabs. Fortunately, Oceana had it. I just wanted a taste, so I ordered one crab. It came with a cocktail dipping sauce. The crab was so good and had a texture comparable to shrimp tempura. 

I had Oceana Grill on my first night in New Orleans and it was a great start to the trip. All these flavors were so new to me and worked so well with every dish. My only complaint is that when you order take-out they give you something like Hawaiian bread instead of toasted baguette slices. Other than that, I loved all the food here and highly recommend it. 

Tips and Notes:
- If you order pickup online through their website, there is a slight discount for first-time users. Not sure if this is an ongoing thing, but something to keep in mind. 
- Most of the regular dishes had appetizer/ smaller sized dishes for you to taste and try. So, if you're overwhelmed and don't know what to get, you can get tons of mini dishes.",2022-01-13 18:26:47

Typical of some of the other New Orleans deep-fried venues, but nothing that made this place stand out.  We started off with a few appetizers, the alligator bites were in little tiny pieces, and the raw oysters were dry and a little off-tasting.  For dinner I had the fried oyster Po boy, it had good flavor but not very many oysters, and the gumbo that came with it was on the bland side. The best part of the meal may have been the desserts.

Our waiter was super nice and prompt. We ordered the gator bites as an appetizer, we got half crispy and half grilled. I liked the crispy way better since the gator meat was kind of chewy so the crispy texture from the fried batter complemented it.

I ordered a beer since it was our vacation and I needed a non-sweet drink. For my meal, I had the jambalaya pasta which was out of this world. It came with pieces of bread on the side. The sauce was out of this universe. It had the perfect kick to it. There were shrimp in it and the pasta was perfect. I literally slurped all of it up.

We realize that with hurricanes, Covid and employee shortages, things are not ideal.  However, we had great food at other places and were impressed with many other restaurants and dining experiences.

Pros:  The Cajun Pasta and Mardi Gras Pasta were great, with good flavor and lots of seafood.  The Ultimate Bloody Mary was literally an entire meal - so much food stuck into it that it could easily have filled one person to the brim.  Flavor of bloody Mary was good, but not perfect.

Cons:  EVERY SINLGE PIECE of fried seafood was very overcooked.  Like, VERY.  Oysters should not be chewy, but these were so dry that it was gross.  The baked oysters were overcooked and they forgot to bring them for 45 minutes,  They did bring us barbecued shrimp, which we didn't order.

This place may improve with more training for the employees.  We spent $200 and could only eat less than half of what we ordered because the fried items were so overcooked.

For entrees, my husband ordered the shrimp fettuccine Alfredo. While he enjoyed the meal and said the Alfredo had good flavor, the sauce was a bit runny and it definitely wasn't presented with jumbo gulf shrimp. The shrimp were on the small side.

We found Oceana on Yelp and decided to check it out. The wait wasn't that long and they were able to get a table inside for our party of 8, within 5 minutes. I was in it for the oysters.

Oh, Yelp. You've steered me wrong with this one. 

We ordered:
-Gator tail bites
-Oceana's Famous Oysters
-Fried shrimp po-boy
-Taste of New Orleans
-Cesar salad
-Greek Salad

Though there were no complaints for those that ordered the Taste of New Orleans, let me just say that Oceana's Famous Oysters were bad. The menu describes the oysters as ""Freshly shucked Louisiana Oysters  on the half-shell, chargrilled over an open flame, smothered with our unique zesty garlic and cream herb Cajun sauce, finished with a blend of Parmesan and Romano cheeses."" In no way did the oysters ever tasted charbroiled. You should also take ""smoothered"" to heart. It was smothered so much that sauce was oozing everywhere. No hint of garlic or cheese in the dish. The oysters drowning in sauce was just slimey. 

The gator tail bites were interesting. Though they looked like bits of battered and fried pork nibblets, they still kinda tasted like chicken. The shrimp po-boy was a bit on the small side. I thought it was also a bit overpriced. You can get better po-boys at Verti Marte, less than half a mile a way. 

Our server was good. The staff that brought out the food seemed a bit confused. But, we managed to get all our food in a reasonable amount of time. There was a bit of a mix up, when it came to our bill and paying with 3 credit cards. Our server split the entire check equally between the 3 cards, when we had written our actual amounts on the back of the check.  But, our group figured it all out. 

For some reason, Oceana Grill reminded me of a TGIF restaurant, if TGIF were to have a seafood joint. Merely, okay and overpriced food. Half the tables around us weren't cleaned properly. So, cleanliness was questionable. Avoid the oysters, they were gross. There are many other (and better) places to eat, for your authentic Cajun/Creole cravings. This place is a big fat PASS.",2017-11-02 20:09:26

We were told it was an hour wait, down a stinky  alley/construction sight in the hot Louisiana sun. We were starving but Oceana seemed worth it.

After 1 hour an 38 minutes we were seated. About 20 minutes later we got our drinks, about 25 minutes after that we got all of our food, and we ordered a lot.

I want to take off more stars because I'm angry that the wait was SO LONG, you see the same people sitting with empty plates (through the windows outside) for very long stretches of time. There were empty tables with dishes on them all over the place, why did we have to wait so dang long?!!  It took a while to get the check and to get our table cleaned, I just dont understand. COVID restrictions were lifted, so tables weren't empty because of this.

We got:
×Gumbo - pretty good
×Crawfish etouffee with added crispy crawfish on top - excellent!!
×Some over-priced nonsense drink - I didnt finish, but it was pretty
×BBQ shrimp - so not worth it, we didn't finish
×World Famous Crabcake - HOLY WOW, UNBELIEVABLY AMAZING
×Catfish plate with fries - this makes me emotional, one of the best single food items I have ever had, seriously. My gosh, that catfish!!!!

We had the Alligator bits, Crab cakes and Blackened Shrimp. Each one was a taste treat. And I felt like we were absorbing some of the local character. I really recommend you think about doing as we did and try multiple appetizers rather than a meal to get a broader perspective of the cuisine. It worked for us; but we are not huge eaters. The dinner plates were much bigger.
We selected Bread Pudding for dessert. Now we eat Bread Pudding with some degree of regularity and we are picky about it. So when John recommended it, we were skeptical. We needn't have been. It was perfect; very tasty with a scrumptious rum sauce that really sealed the deal1

Located right off Bourbon St., it was a great place to swing by. Plus, open until 1am, we had plenty of time to wait in line for food. The line was kind of long out the door on a Friday, but it moved quickly. We only waited for about 20 minutes. 

We ordered the Redfish Oceana ($28),Blackened Shrimp Fettuccine Alfredo ($20), and the Seafood Gumbo ($11). The prices are not bad, but they are a little on the higher end for the food. However, it's right downtown, so it's to be expected. 

Every item was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The redfish was a little crisp where the fish hit the pan, but soft and juicy overall. I came with a delicious creamy crawfish mushroom sauce that made it really feel like New Orleans cuisine. The alfredo had a thick rich sauce with flavorful blackened shrimp. The seafood gumbo tasted as expected, but it was served in a decently deep bowl! Usually, buying gumbo downtown results in it being served in tiny cups that they call ""bowls"", but Oceana Grill didn't skimp on their gumbo portions!  I do wish, however, that the gumbo had some crab claws in it, but it was yummy!

Besides the gumbo, if you're a small eater, you might be full with the portions they serve you here, but if you're a big eater like me, you'll want to order some extra appetizers.

My friends and I went here for both dinner and brunch. Saying their Alfredo sauce is delicious is a serious understatement. There are no words to describe it. I had the ahi tuna, and it was amazing with the crawfish sauce! 
For brunch, I had their Cajun breakfast and it was amazing! 
Definitely will go back on my next trip!",2015-01-10 02:13:55

It was delicious and seasoned very well. They place is a nice size so even at 11pm during a festival our wait was less than 10 minutes. Our server Ashleigh was very nice. I will definitely be going back!,2019-04-13 14:33:16

Right off the main drag, it's a very big restaurant with different levels.  Even though they were very busy throughout the night, I never felt neglected by our server - who was so very nice!  The food was delicious, the prices were fair and with a reservation you'll get in with no time .... even with 20 people!  I recommend to start off your New Orleans vacation.",2018-11-13 14:00:30

We wanted just the sides and small items to tide us over, i.e. jambalaya, not a large meal or anything. So we ordered $5 jambalaya and some dungeness crabcakes. The crabcakes were thick and fat. Good bang for your buck.. And the jambalaya was amazing.... could have been the food version of beer goggles, I'll never know.

One friend in our group asked the waiter for the best fish they had. This turned out to be $30... We'll never stop giving him shit for ordering such an expensive item as a midnight snack. 

Another friend in the group is vegetarian and struggled the entire trip with finding vegetarian options. This restaurant was nice enough to let him bring him his cheese pizza in so he could at least eat with us. Woo!",2015-10-02 22:48:10

He had a trainee with him and she was wonderful as well. They suggested the Cadillac Margarita and the crab cakes and of course we got both. We also ordered the fries as an appetizer and they were all great. For our entrees I hit the Mardi Gras pasta and Errol suggested a blackened fish on top of jambalaya with fried crawfish and some sauce and it was fantastic! Over all it was such a great experience. The host at the front door was also a gem, she was super cool. We really enjoyed our dinner and the experience we had. Thank y'all for such a great birthday dinner!",2022-01-10 03:50:02

The food Was not amazing but it was not bad. 
Drinks were good. 
Being smack in the middle of it all, is one downfall for me. I don't tend to eat in the touristy areas when on vacation because I feel like this is what happens... you get decent food.",2021-12-22 12:41:52

Freshly shucked louisiana oysters on the half-shell, chargrilled over an open flame, smothered with our unique zesty garlic and cream herb cajun sauce, finished with a fresh blend of parmesan and romano cheeses.   1/2 Doz. $10.50 / Doz. $17.50
*pretty tasty, a little confused that they had the sauce on top of the bread instead of bringing bread out that you could dip into the sauce because it was really soggy

Blackened Bayou Duck
Smoked till it's tender then blackened and topped with a crawfish mushroom cream sauce, served with jambalaya and sautéed vegetables.
*the duck was pretty chewy and there was barely any sauce, the jambalaya was really plain but the sauteed greens were the best part of the dish.

Golden Cadillac
Your choice of Olmeca Altos Plata or Patron Silver, Cointreau and a Grand Marnier float
*tasty solid Margarita and it has dry ice so it looks as good as it tastes

Overall the food is good but in comparison it was toward the bottom of all the meals I had in Nola.",2018-11-04 20:35:44

Located in the heart of the bourbon street construction-Uber had to let us out about 3 blocks away and walk was a bit dicey with the construction. Anyway, we were seated quickly and service was prompt. My husband and I both had the ribs and fries- ribs were tender and fries were properly cooked. Our daughter had red beans and rice and gave it a thumbs up. Scotch and waters were pretty weak for the price. Server was very nice.",2019-10-04 21:15:38
CInLnWl8ULeuG_jhnSDppA,rrfHL-1xvGM3kDaXsNDkQA,ac1AeYqs8Z4_e2X5M3if2A,4,2,1,2,"3.5 stars. Came in with some friends as our first meal in NOLA! Heard so many great things about this place so we just had to try it. We got seated immediately and the waiter was attentive. 

F O O D: 
- Seafood Gumbo ($5.50/cup): (5/5) the gumbo was perfectly seasoned and wasn't too salty. There was plenty of seafood so that I got something in every bite. I can definitely see why New Orleans is known for their gumbo. 
- Oceana famous oysters ($17.50/dz): (4/5) flavorful but didn't knock my socks off since they are considered their ""famous"" oysters. 
- Redfish Oceana ($22.00): (3/5) the fish was on the drier side and did not have much flavor. The breading was good and the sauce wasn't as flavorful as I expected. 

Overall, Oceana Grill is a great place for a late night snack but I wouldn't be back since there are so many other restaurants to try.",2017-05-29 21:34:04
