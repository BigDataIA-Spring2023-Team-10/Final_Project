It went by fairly quick but I do recommend having a drink in hand while you wait. We sat at the bar in front of Hollywood, the Master Shucker, and he was great! Super focused on his work but attentive enough to not keep us waiting on anything. We tried both the fresh oysters and the chargrilled and boy, were those phenomenal.

Service was good too, our waiter Roscoe was super nice. Brandon seated us was super friendly. I appreciate the great service. 

Prices are pretty much the same as other restaurants in the French Quarter. 

There's always have a line to get in, stand in it... it's worth the wait. But I personally wouldn't stand in the line for more than 10 - 15 minutes... there are other great seafood restaurants in the French Quarter.",8/23/18 20:58

I can't tell you what goes into this dish, but it must have included some garlic, parmesan cheese, and possibly butter?  No matter what, I really enjoyed these oysters.  If you check out ACME for nothing else, at least try the chargrilled oysters.  You won't be disappointed.

I also had a 1/2 and 1/2 po'boy--half fried catfish, half fried shrimp.  The sandwich was tasty, but far from spectacular.  On a separate occasion, I tried the fried crawfish tail appetizer, which was served with a delicious sauce (aioli probably, with horseradish).  Again, nothing out of the ordinary.

Needless to say, stick to those chargrilled oysters.  The raw oysters are just fine also, to be sure.  I did find it odd that when they shucked the oysters, they left all the sandy mud on the outside of the shell, which meant odds were good that some of the sand would infiltrate your oyster.  Not sure why they do that, considering how texture is so important when it comes to oysters, and the last thing you want is to bite on a grain of crunchy sand while your trying to enjoy your meal.  Oh well.

I would definitely stop here for lunch again someday.  In fact, I went there two days in a row already!",10/6/10 8:03

Everything else is mediocre to horrible. Dont touch the fried seafood or anything like etoufee 

It is fun to belly up to the oyster bar and rap with the shuckers.  some have been there decades and they have some stories to tell.

Did have a bad experience though last time i was there. We went to settle the bill as the shucker who had been entertaining us encouraged us to pay cash. Why? so he could stuff the tip in his pocket and not share with the rest of the wait staff. He as much as told us that

This is whats depressing about NOLA at times, good, authentic, hard working, jive talking worker giving us a great show at the same time trying to beat the rest of the staff out of their living.  No honor anymore

you want good fried seafood go to Bozos in metairie, or even Jaggers in Harahan",4/10/13 17:41

For lunch around noon, it only took 20 minutes. We were seated at the oyster bar and promptly served our food.

Each time I enjoyed the fresh oysters and chargrilled oysters.  I think both are some of the best in town.  The atmosphere is casual and the beer expensive, but the food is good - that's why they've been in business for the past 100 years. 

Compared with some of the other reviewers, guess I have been lucky to have had pretty good service on each of my visits.  Hell, the waitress even bought our last round of beers on my second visit - of course lunch was disrupted by the guy having a stroke at the next table being carted out by the EMTs.

The atmosphere inside is great - plenty going on but still able to have a conversation.

The food - the specialty is the chargrilled oysters, and they are a MUST HAVE if you're in New Orleans. The best I've had. Cooked in just the right amount of butter, garlic and cheese, with fresh bread to slurp up the extra sauce, these are big, creamy flavoursome oysters that even non-seafood fans should try. The boo fries are also a great addition, as are their poboys, gumbo and fried crawfish tails.

Were they the BEST OYSTERS EVER? No. I had oysters the night before at Mr. Ed's Seafood House and they were just as great and they were $5 cheaper. 

My brother & I decided on here for lunch since we saw the line wrapping around the corner the night before. We stood in the line for a late lunch around 3:30pm on a Monday and were seated in less than 5 minutes. It's all about timing with these popular spots. If you come on the weekend, expect a long wait. I would recommend planning for one weekday during your trip for less wait times. Our waitress was fun & sassy. She got right to it with putting in our order of charbroiled oysters. I had the 1/2 shrimp po-boy with a cup of seafood gumbo and my brother settled on a bowl of seafood gumbo. The gumbo was DELICIOUS! I thoroughly enjoyed it. My brother thought it was tasty, served at the perfect temperature and had large chunks of crawfish & shrimp. My shrimp po-boy was good as well. It reminded me of the fish sandwiches I would get from Wendy's back in St. Croix growing up. I know it seems weird but fast food in the Caribbean taste drastically different than that in the United States. This is a compliment for them. Being that it reminded me of something so simple, it was just okay for me. Damn you St. Croix for spoiling me with great tasting food from birth. We finished up with the bread pudding. That was the most memorable part of the meal. My brother commented that he wanted to lick the bowl when we were done but decided that it would be frowned upon if he did. Our bill came up to $57.29 for 2 iced teas, a dozen chargrilled oysters, 1 bowl of gumbo, a 1/2 shrimp po-boy & cup of gumbo & a bread pudding. After tip, we spent around $66. That's where the 3 stars come in. 

You can enjoy oysters and good food here at Acme but I wouldn't recommend waiting in a long line for it. There are 50 billion restaurants in New Orleans and they all claim to have the BEST ___________ (fill in the blank). With that being said, you can find great oysters all throughout the city. I recommend befriending a local at the bar, in your hotel or your Uber driver for off-the-beaten path eateries that will give you authentic, memorable food minus the wait and the bill.",8/6/15 23:15

I tried both restaurants back to back recently. At Acme I had the grilled oysters and an oyster po boy. The grilled oyster was delicious but a bit salty. The po boy was exquisite.

THREE YEARS! I was not to be deterred this time around. Glad the weather was on my side as well as. Someone must have known I would have thrown a fit if I wasn't able to come again this time.

Got here around 5:45-ish and the line was decent. It only got kept getting longer after we arrived. We had a party of six and they were nice enough to hold our table for the 5 to 10 minutes it took until the last two people of our party arrived. After being seated, the waiter came by and took our orders. Obviously being called an Oyster House, you have to order the oysters!

The boyfriend and I split an order of a half-dozen raw oysters, a half-dozen chargrilled oysters, and the fried seafood platter (oyster, shrimp, and fish). The raw oysters were nice and fresh, although expect an inconsistency of size. Some were big and others medium. As for the chargrilled, these oysters might have been small due to the cooking process but they came out bubbling in seasoned butter and cheese that was just oh so tasty! I was literally sticking the bread in all the leftover butter I could get! Hell, I probably would have drank the seasoned butter right from the oyster shell if it wasn't super hot! Definitely a must when you come here!

As for the fried seafood platter, these was a delicious dish as well. The fried fish was nice and tender. The fried oysters were nice and big with a good oyster taste, unlike some places that give you the dinky small oysters that's mostly batter (YES! I'm talking about you Pappadeux!). The fried shrimp was cooked perfectly that I definitely cried when one fell of the plate on to the floor. Yes, I'll admit, I contemplated about the 5 second rule, but with the streets of New Orleans being as dirty as they were, I decided it was better left there then in my stomach.

As for why 4 stars? I can't remember if they wrote down our order or not, but when we ordered the seafood platter, we asked for a side of coleslaw (absolutely delicious btw).

I will say that the charred oysters are TOTALLY worth the wait in the line. The few times I have been, the wait wasn't too bad.

The char grilled oysters come out fresh and piping hot, you can even see the guy making them in one section of the restaurant. Don't forget to dip your french bread into the nice butter afterwards. So good.  Learn from my lesson and just stick to the basics when ordering.

I didn't get a chance to try the charbroiled oysters, just the raw ones, but I wish I had.  From someone else I went with, she said they were delish!

So if you're a party of 5 that came first before a party of 4, but a table clears for a party of 4, they are going to seat them first.

Otherwise, pretty standard New Orleans standards.  The shrimp gumbo didn't actually have any shrimp in it.  I guess that counts as a complaint thought the flavor was good.  The red beans and rice were above average though I preferred Popeye's so . . .

4. Boo fries. Oh EM GEE. So bomb! It was fries with either pulled pork or pulled beef with gravy and cheese. It was fantastic! 
5. Chargrilled oysters. This was what we waited in line for 45 min for. We were greedy and ordered a dozen and a half (18). It was yummy and the burnt cheese was surprisingly delicious but after a while it just got too salty. 

All in all the food was good. Food came out a little too slow in my opinion. Service was decent. Like others have said, they kind of want to just rush you in and out. But they're definitely still friendly though. I liked it, just don't know if I'd wait 45 min to an hour for it again.",4/23/16 5:11

I don't get what all the hype is about. Drinks took forever coming from the bar, and they were pretty weak to boot. We ordered a dozen oystersto start, what came to the table was 10.5,with chips of shell in most of them. On the New Orleans sampler, the gumbo wasn't really edible, with any amount of various hot sauces; the red beans and rice were bland, and the jambalaya and sausage were pretty good.The Peace maker Po-boy, I'll hand it to them, delicious! Great flavor, and very generous on the portion.

Service was spotty at best, and it took a while to get our check, and then the credit card run. And when we looked at our bill, instead  of being charged for a dozen oysters (10.5) we were charge for a dozen & 1/2dozen.

So you go in. It's cramped, its crowded. Tables are shoved in places that they really shouldn't be. I get it. They're famous, they're busy, they need to accommodate. 

Everyone says to sit at the bar. I beg to differ. Those people shucking the oysters? Do it extremely slowly. They look like they just held an oyster for the first time that day. Really awkward movements and the like. Not that much of a show. Also much messier. 

Waitress? In the beginning she was constantly harping on us to order more. ""No, that's definitely not enough."" Things like that. It was really rude. If I wanna walk in there and order a drink and walk out its not her business. 

The oysters? Not fresh. I don't know if I went on a bad day or something. But they were definitely not fresh. Also, there were pieces of the shell in the oyster. Almost broke one of my teeth on it. Not very professional at all. Chargrilled oysters were better because you couldn't taste that they weren't fresh. 

ACME susnet drink. Was one of the better things I ordered. A little strong, though. 

1/2 and 1/2 seafood platter with shrimp and fish. Expensive! For that price, I thought I'd get this hugeeee plate. I'd say that that plate would feed one VERY hungry person or 2 very full people. The taste was alright but nothing to die for. $15 and up for that quality of a platter? I'd rather go to some chain restaurant. 

Bread pudding was really the best thing that I ordered. Although they did put a little too much whiskey. Alcohol is a nice thing to have in desserts. But everything in moderation, right?",5/28/12 20:57

The server brought out our bill and had us write beside what we ordered which check it should be put on. So imagine 13 people taking their turn marking down what they ate on the bill. THEN brought back the 3 bills and we had to figure out who owed what on THAT bill. Thankfully we had cash!! 

I ordered the shrimp platter. Asked the server if I could get onion rings. Would've gladly paid an up-charge. He said no. I thought he was being sarcastic, but he wasn't. He literally said he's not allowed to make that substitution. WTH seriously?? What kind of restaurant doesn't allow substitutions?? 

My shrimp platter was average. Reminded me of Popeyes fast food shrimp. The Boo fries were surprisingly good. I was drinking Hurricanes. They were $9 each. Not worth it. I'm not a heavy drinker. I had three hurricanes and barely had a buzz. 

The server was very slow and didn't seem to care if we were happy with anything.

As a native of New Orleans, I highly recommend Acme to anyone, tourist or local. You will find both sorts of guest eating there on any given day.

Acme is know for their charbroiled oysters. After you've sampled them plain, try them with the green Tabasco sauce, or another green, jalapeno-based hot sauce. If you don't like oysters at all, Acme has much other New Orleans cuisine to offer. Of course they serve good gumbo and excellent poor boys.

In my mind, Acme will always be paired with Drago's restaurant, and I certainly recommend Drago's as well. In fact, Drago's retains a certain mystique that Acme is at least perceived to lack. For many years, Drago's had only a single location. It was located in a near suburb of New Orleans, and thus had to subsist almost entirely on local business. As a result, Drago's is more of a part of local New Orleans culture than is Acme.

Acme, from its beginning, had a sort of financial head start on Drago's, due to its downtown location. Acme has not sat on its laurels, though. Rather, it has kept pace with Drago's as menus have been honed and expectations raised. I do not hesitate to rate Acme ""5 star.""",2/24/16 3:34

And if you have any room left over, you're also gonna want to put everything on the menu Acme Oyster House in you as well.

Here's the blueprint for how to get this place done right:

#1 - Get your group on the line that forms outside (don't be intimidated, it moves quicker than you'd expect)
#2 - Dispatch two members of your group to buy 36 oz street beers 
#3 - Drink said beers while you wait on line for the next 20-30 minutes.  
#4 - Get seated/immediately order 2 pounds of crawfish (i.e. ""Crawdaddies"") for each person in your group.  Crack, peel, snarf.  
#5 - Ask your waiter what the fastest ""15 dozen oysters"" record time is.  You'll be floored, then disgusted, and then you'll incredulously do the math for the next 15 minutes before realizing that some people in this world truly ARE sick.  
#6 - Get the Jambalaya.  I had 5 bowls of Jamba down in NoLa and this was the best.  
#7 - Encourage the people in your group (who you don't want to come out after dinner) to order the New Orleans Bread Pudding.  Game/set/match. Night over.  
#8 - Go back to your hotel and shower.  
#9 - No seriously.

I saw how the male shook hands with the doorman. Sorry but the entire line witnessed that!!! Me personally while I stood in heels for 2 hours!! That is NOT okay.

The various staff I dealt with was very curt. This is not something I've dealt with when visiting Nola.

But the real kicker were the subpar oysters. They upsold me on getting charbroiled instead of raw. Maybe chargrilling oysters makes them shrink, but these things were rather small at $2 a pop. I didn't care for the parmesan/butter/whatever sauce they were smothered in. Too salty and sapped all the oyster flavor away.

I also got a half shrimp half fish poboy. The fried fish was paper thing. There was more breadcrumb than fish. The shrimp was also on the skimpy side. All in all, $30 and I felt like I just ate a bunch of salty, fried bread.

We shared a dozen of the Chargrilled Oysters.  They came out sizzling with a cap of golden melted cheese on top.  The oysters were good but the could've been shucked a bit better.  There were definitely traces of shell in a few of mine. Meh...

I ordered a bowl of the sea food gumbo.  The base flavor was ok.  The seafood was pretty skimpy mostly shrimp meat with a few shreds of crab.  For the price I'm not sure what I expected.

A couple of friends ordered the 1/2 and 1/2 platter to share.  It came with fried fish and fried oysters.  The plate was huge filled to the edge with golden fried goodness.  All four of us ended up having to chip in to finish it.  We didn't mind.

We also had the fried crab claws.  They were cute and fun to eat. Especially with beer (Abita Amber) and a game on the big screen. 

We were so taken with the Chargrilled oysters from Sunday we decided to venture back for another dozen on Monday.  The restaurant was much quieter.  The oysters were cleaned perfectly this time.

The oyster shuckers were standing right in front of us, and were friendly and engaging.  They recommended different ways to dress our oysters, talked about life in New Orleans, asked us where we were from, etc.  It was fun to sit and talk with them.

Watching the shuckers, you can tell the oysters here are fresh, they just keep shucking and shucking!

Along with the oysters, we tried a couple of po'boys, (oyster, soft shell crab, and combo oyster/shrimp.)  The soft shell crab was my favorite.  We also had the boiled crawfish, which was perfectly spicy.

Anyway, the food was anything but great.  Perhaps we ordered wrong - but we each ordered a ""Poompa"", which is gumbo poured over and into a bread bowl.  i got the seafood gumbo and my partner got the chicken gumbo.

First off, the mini loaf of bread looked like french bread, but it was nothing but a loaf of white bread (it looked and tasted like wonder bread - but round instead of square).  Yuck on that.

The next issue was that the gumbo was almost all rice and there wasn't much there.  Basically, the making of this dish was that they put a loaf of white bread in a bowl, skinned off a top layer of the bread, put a mound of rice on it and then dumped about 1/2 cup (maybe a 1/3 cup) of gumbo on top of it.  We left hungry and not satisfied at all.

We do have to say their french fries were really good (at $1.99).  Our  ""Poompa"" bread gumbo bowls were about $12 each - and not worth it.

We ordered a dozen chargrilled oysters with a side of jambalaya and red beans and rice. For some weird reason, our sides come out first. Not sure if that was a mistake, or if that's just how they do things around there? Regardless, both side dishes were amazing. The jambalaya was perfectly seasoned. It had a bit of heat to it but it was just right. The red beans and rice were very hearty, quite thick, and had a milder flavor. 

When the oysters arrived, I was quite surprised by the lovely presentation. They were big, fresh, steamy, and had cheese and oil on top. The oysters also came with 5-6 slices of bread to soak the richness from the oyster shells. The oysters were delicious, flavorful, and very filling.

We were dying to have some New Orleans crawfish but reading online, we found out that the quarter is not so great for crawfish. Instead, we settled on eating a good appetizer before the night started. I saw online there was a lot of great reviews for Acme so we decided to try this place out. 

We parked and walked towards the restaurant. Right away, we noticed there was a line of about 10 people standing outside. I was a little impressed to see there was actually a line - it has to be good, right?! We stood in line and because it was only two of us, we were able to get seated pretty quickly - before the 10 people.

Half of our party decided to try both the raw oysters and the char grilled oysters. I was told that raw oysters were good, but certainly not the best anyone had had and not the best that they had tried while in NOLA. The char grilled were different, and no one had tried anything like them. The garlic parm sauce did smell amazing, but what wouldn't in garlic parm?

The rest of the party tried the gumbo, a po boy, the crab cake platter and the New Orleans medley. The food was enjoyable, but not special. The one thing I will say that was a huge disappointment was the crab cake. It was like a hockey puck of fried filler with some slight crab taste. Not really recognizable as crab. The hush puppies were good though.

A dozen chargrilled oysters here costs 1 lap dance. A dozen fresh will run you 1 huge ass beer. Both are well worth the price.

The plate was sizzling hot when placed in front of us, and I could see the cheese still bubbling. The smell was intoxicating and when eaten (carefully, given how hot they are!), the butter and cheese coupled with the oysters was the perfect marriage. I only wish that they gave more bread, because I used mine to soak up the rest of the sauce after eating my oyster and I definitely could have used another. 

We also ordered a dozen of their raw Gulf oysters. I prefer cleaner, sweeter oysters such as Kusshi or Kumamoto oysters but these weren't too bad. They are briny but not too much, and they tasted fresh.

My friends and I came to the Oyster Bar for dinner on a Saturday night and as expected there was a wait, a 45 minute wait. We decided that this was the place we wanted to try while in New Orleans, so we waited our time. 15 minutes had passed after we asked the host how much time did she think was left. She responded unsure and said possibly another 25 minutes. IMMEDIATELY, after she says that 3 people out of our party of 7 walked away from the line to use a porter potty outside because a friend could not hold her bladder any longer. A friend that stayed in line calls us back through phone to tells us to hurry and walk back since we were being seated faster than expected (not even 2 minutes have passed since she said we were probably going to wait for another 25 minutes). 

We walk back and and notice our friends are seated by the door so we join them. The manager immediately walks over and asks the group ""where did you all come from""? My friends and I thought it was a joke and he was just starting conversation, but we were mistaken. He asked us once more ""no, seriously, where did you guys come from?"" So, we responded that we just walked back from the restroom and he began to tell us that there are no restrooms outside (there are) and us walking away was unfair for the other guests that have been waiting in line all night. We explained that we have been waiting in line JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

The craziest part is, we called the host over to back us up because she was outside with us and saw us the entire time. When I asked her if she come over and speak to the manager and be our witness she said okay and that it was no problem. She walked over with me and when she began to speak and tell the manager that we left to use the restroom and actually waited our time in line...THE MANAGER SAID ""walk away, I got this"". ???? That was unbelievable and disrespectful. He treats his staff and guests like crap, clearly. 

To make a long story short, the manager said we needed to leave after we continued to tell him that everything he was saying was wrong and unfair to us because we waited outside in the cold and he made all the attention on us as if we were animals that shouldn't be there.

We waited in the line outside (which was no big, by the way, moved super fast, and we made friends in line...bonus!) and were seated within less than 10 minutes of arriving. I figured a long line meant it's got to be delish inside. 

**Rubs hands together in excitement**

Anyway. We are seated at one of the communal tables and order up some Hurricanes because we are loser tourists. They were excellent. We also ordered some chargrilled oysters. Those were really very good. Something about the heavy char worked really well with the lightness of the salty oyster. Win!

Since we were starving from walking around on our cemetery tour, we also ordered the boo fries (fries covered in roast beef gravy and cheese) - really tasty. Exactly the sort of artery-clogging dish we wanted at the time. 

As for an entree, we wanted to try a little bit of everything, so our waitress suggested some sort of fried fish sampler platter. It had crawfish, white fish, and fried shrimp. I wasn't thrilled with this. I have had better. I just think it was a little too doughy...I can't even really put my finger on it. I just wasn't impressed and don't know that I would bother if I were to go back to NOLA. 

But for the chargrilled oysters and those Hurricanes, I might recommend it if there's no line. I will say the waitstaff was friendly, but it was hard to get her attention which is always a bummer, especially when your drink is empty...

(2) Raw oysters - again one of the best, no sea smell, but rather small.  (3) shrimp & fish platter - very good although the fries were cold. (4) shrimp etouffee - good but cold (5) kids burgers - not good at all, also cold.

I wouldn't have darkened their door except that my family was in town, and for some reason they have a mortal fear of traveling outside the Quarter, and this place always has a line outside the door, so they assumed it was going to be good. The line outside is totally misleading: the restaurant makes everyone wait outside for a table, even when there are plenty of empty tables inside! It is complete theater! They just want to look like they are constantly busy, so they make everyone wait outside and the hosts seat parties at a purposely...shall we say ""deliberate""...pace.

Inside is a bustling, high-volume operation, with a menu that contains all the NOLA seafood standards. During our visit, we had a dozen raw oysters ($13.50), and they were good...shucked in such a way that the liquor remained, served with all the normal accoutrements. For my entree, I had a fried soft shell crab platter ($16.99) with french fries and cole slaw. The crab tasted very good and fresh, and though it was fried perhaps a little too ""vigorously,"" it had a nice cornmeal crust. The fries and slaw were so-so. Another member of my party had the Peace Maker po-boy ($12.99), which contained fried oysters, shrimp and a Tabasco-infused mayo. I had a bite and it was pretty delicious...if I ever find myself at Acme again, I'm going to order this. Another member of my party had the New Orleans Medley ($12.99), a sampler trio of gumbo, jambalaya and red beans & rice. They were all competent versions of NOLA classics, but definitely nothing to write home about.

For dessert we shared a bread pudding with whiskey sauce ($4.99). It was OK...again, I've had much better. It was a little bit dense and oversweet. The restaurant is very noisy during dinner time, and service is brusque but competent. For a tourist place, you could do a lot worse than Acme. You could also go outside the quarter and go somewhere like Superior Seafood, which costs about the same and is far, far better in every way.",3/2/12 19:31

D-He be the hostess with the mostest, fabulous baby. And funny too. 

Hollywood AKA M.-He is the best oyster shucker far and wide. He's been shucking oysters for over 35 years and in doing so has been able to travel the country. Ain't nobody finna shuck an oyster like him. Check the video for proof.

Lily-She is an extremely friendly waitress who is quick-fast on her feet and does everything with a smile. She also knows where to hang out for the night. 

James AKA Mr. Classic Man-He was cool too, but mostly just cute, LOL.

Okay, so my friend and I came to this place after hearing good things about it. Upon our arrival, we noticed that the line was pretty much down the block and were like um no. But the host told us that if we sit at the bar then the wait would only be like 20 minutes. Sounds good I said. Less than ten minutes later, we were inside, at the bar with menus in hand. 

As we sat, waited, and chatted, I learned from the infamous Mr. Hollywood, how to shuck an oyster, what makes an oyster good, how oysters are caught, mad other things about oysters and a little something about clams and mussels too. 

I opted for the charbroiled oysters and the soup of the day, lobster and corn bisque. Fam! That. Food. Was. Legit. Like legit legit. I wanted seconds and thirds but the way my stomach is set up...The bisque, cooked to taste with the right amount of lobster and corn. The oysters, damn them oysters. I wonder if they can be mailed to me. They had the perfect amount of garlicky butter and apparently there was cheese on them which was not overpowering at all. 

My friend had the catfish and fries and was given enough of it to take on home. She absolutely loved it by the way. 

We both got some food to go because it was oh so good. I'm trying to bring it back to Brooklyn but we gon see.

Also, The chargrilled oysters were laughable.  

They were actually not super swamped inside, since we went at 2:30 pm to avoid the 1hr+ line.  However, you still had to do a headstand just to get some wait attention.  As for the oysters, the chargrilled ones were so shrunken in their shells that you couldnt even tell they were oysters anymore... I'm not really sure how chargrilled oysters are supposed to look, or if there is a perfect way to do them, but Drago's oysters made Acme oysters look like oyster remains after they've been left out in the sun for a month.  They were so small and shriveled, barely with any flavor.  Their regular oysters were decent, but nothing mind blowing.  It's pretty hard to mess up regular oysters.

The people were the best part of the restaurant, the customers!  THere seemed to be a good mix of locals who were extremely friendly, which is always a good sign. And they made the wait more bearable.

We stopped by for our last meal at this iconic seafood spot during the afternoon (before noon) with no wait.

I've never had a po-boy before, so I was quite excited to finally try one of the most-talked-about sandwich of New Orleans. I thought it was good, but nothing amazing to rave about. The soups were both great additions with the sandwiches, as they were hearty and great for dipping with the baguette. I'll recommend the seafood gumbo over the corn soup. 

Acme is great place if you want to try a variety of po-boys/southern food, as they have options for two halves of different po-boys, as well as po-boys with sides or soups.

To give an example, my non-Southern ass walks in there and asks for some drawn butter to use for my boiled crawfish. Given that tradition says to eat crawfish as is, my server looked at me like I just told her to toss my salad. Nevertheless, she took care of my need. I came back here a couple days later and not only did she remember me, but she also remembered that I eat my crawfish with butter without me having to request it. Awesome!

On a more intimate level, I feel deprived here in California where servers at restaurants don't address you with such endearing terms  as ""Honey,"" ""Sweetie,"" or ""Sugar."" While my favorite had to have been called ""Cutie,"" I couldv'e sworn one lady in there even called me ""Hot Cakes.""

I had a little bit of everything. Their fish batter has secret spices in it (they won't tell you, I tried), giving it a cajun kick that contrasts nicely with their house tartar sauce.

And their oysters were SO fresh and SO clean **Outkast plays in background** I normally dont eat oysters because even the slightest fishy taste or grit in the oyster grosses me out. But theirs are served on a bed of ice, and as clean and fresh as they come. I also really liked their gumbo and red beans and rice.

I'm sure you're thinking, this place is absolutely touristy but in actuality, this place was BOMB. The wait is worth it.

So what I suggest to do is make your wife or someone weaker than you wait in line and you go to a bar near by, meander your way through the crowd, get some beers and bring it back in line because in New Orleans you can drink on the street. Time flew so fast and the southern hospitality of the people in line really creates great company while waiting. The food was absolutely delicious.

We were pulling shell fragments out of our mouths that were surprisingly large. Eventually we just started inspecting all the oysters closely to pull out any shells we found, but a lot of the time we were still getting them. They are HORRIBLE at shucking oysters which I found surprising given all the great reviews. The bad thing is that the grilled oysters had the shells pieces cooked in under the cheese, so they were impossible to see until you start chewing and realize there's something hard and crunchy in your mouth. The raw oyster shells themselves were filthy and our napkins were black by the time we finished eating them. My husband absolutely loves oysters and we get them wherever they're served, and this was by far the worst place we've had oysters.

When I called last Friday night, there was an automated answering machine saying they do not take reservations. Somehow, my colleague called and someone said it would be a 20 minute wait. 

We estimate we approached Acme from where we were staying in the Central Business District at 8 pm and thought the line didn't look too bad. It wasn't until 8:40 pm before we sat down. 

I think Leslie was our server and she was awesome. She didn't miss a beat and in that respect was super quick when she could have slowed down. For instance, we took some time to look over the menu and agree on what to share. When she came over, we were ready to list all our choices but instead she heard chargrilled oysters and ran off.

Thankfully, she came back with some water and took the rest of our order: boo fries (with roast beef gravy and cheese), boom boom shrimp, seafood etouffee, and 1/2 & 1/2 po boy (shrimp and fried fish). For dessert, we split the New Orleans Bread pudding with whiskey sauce. All in all, the bill came out to about $75 and we left a $15 tip. 

As far as service, Leslie stopped by once or twice to bring a couple of extra napkins and filled up our cups only after they had been empty for awhile. She was smart to have brought three spoons to share dessert and provided a couple of extra spoons so we can eat family style. 

Everything was amazing but in the end, we agreed we could have done without the boo fries. We loved the chargrilled oysters, as none of us had it prepared that way before. The French bread was great for soaking up the juices and the oysters were well seasoned with spices and cheese.

The boom boom shrimp was delicious and not at all the spicy it promised to be. To me, it was more sweet than spicy, but I loved the shrimp. I also very much enjoyed the etouffee as it was comforting after a long wait out in the cold. My colleague really liked the fish po boy, but I thought both the fish and shrimp were well done. Unfortunately, the pickles arrived with the sandwiches but somehow fell off the plate when the plate hit the table. Too bad. After eating other po boys this weekend, pickles would have been good.

The bread pudding was pretty good too and none of us could detect the whiskey sauce. We were impressed with the diced up apples hidden in the pudding which gave it a little more texture and depth in flavor. 

The place was loud and kind of dark, but with this nice and limited but delicious offering of NOLA foods, it was easy to overlook especially since we were told our non oyster order would come out before the oysters. Oysters ended up coming out first, by the way, but the other food came out pretty soon after we were done.

- Raw oysters: They're HUGE and meaty!  Totally worth the price!  I've never seen oysters as big as these, but it makes me wonder if other places here have the same size too? 
- Char-grilled oysters (aka rockefeller oysters): yum yum in my tum!  I can barely eat oysters (i always stick to the small ones because they're sweeter) but I was able to chow down 2 of these easily!
- Seafood gumbo: It's topped with a little bit of white rice and cheese.. SUPER good and probably one of the better ones I've had. 
- Crawfish tails: Deep fried pieces placed on top of two pieces of bread.  It's a good appetizer portion, but was perfect for me since I dipped some into my gumbo, and had oysters on the side as well.

Acme always gets busy. It's jam-packed but don't worry, you'll have enough room to move your elbows to slurp down your plate of oysters. I wouldn't recommend it for a huge group, though. When I went with 5 of my friends, we shared half of a table with 4 other people. I didn't find it as a problem, but perhaps some of you might not like that or feel like you don't have privacy.

I've always found that the hostess and servers were really friendly and patient. I've never had to wait too long and I was there with a group of 4 and a group of 6 on two different occasions.

Minimal toppings available for the oysters (as it should be) but clean set up which is surprising for a counter in front of an oyster shucker.  The service is excellent and fast, however I was sitting at the bar directly in front of the shucker.

If someone were to ask me to suggest a single restaurant in New Orleans, this would be my choice. This place was recommended to me by one of my flight attendants who grew up in New Orleans.

My girlfriend and I showed up at about 3:00 pm and the line was really long. They said it would be around a 45 minute wait and it turned out to be about 30 minutes before we were seated.

We sat at the bar where we were entertained by watching the workers prepare raw oysters and college football playing on huge TVs. It definitely has a sports bar feel to it. There is a lot of bar seating and there are TVs. It's a bit noisy but nothing too crazy. The lighting is a little weird and redish.

As far as the food goes, I ordered a bowl of seafood gumbo and a dozen chargrilled oysters. My girlfriend ordered the boom boom shrimp. The seafood gumbo was about as good as I've ever had. It had plenty of crab and shrimp in pretty much every bite. The chargrilled oysters were the best oysters I've ever had. They they put some type of cheese on them too which made them that much better. The boom boom shrimp was also great. The shrimp were lightly fried and topped with a bit of a sweet and spicy sauce.

Overall, this place deserves 5/5 stars. Acme is the type of place that I think even the locals hold in high regard. The only negative I can mention is the wait and even that was more than worth it.

The guys behind the bar basically talked more to each other than the customers. They lost an opportunity to interact with the customers. I was less than impress when the lady next to me ask the guy whether they get their oysters from a farm and his response was "" from a vendor"".

Came to NOLA for vacation and came here since a friend recommended it. 

- Ordered: dozen oysters, half dozen charbroiled oysters, soft shell crab poboy, shrimp & oyster poboy, 3 bloody Mary's', shrimp & deviled egg gumbo 

- Food: my favorite item here was the charbroiled oysters and everything else was just ok or not good. The oysters were super fatty and sandy. I prefer small oysters. The oysters were so sandy we didn't even finish it. It was my first time having a po boy so don't really have anywhere to compare it to but it tasted plain to me. The gumbo was okay. 

- Service: below average. We asked for waters and olives 2-3 times from different servers and they all kept forgetting. We finally got water halfway through the meal. 

Ambiance: looks kind of like a diner. It's dark inside and has this red lighting that wasn't comfortable 

- Price: friend paid, but I think around $90 for the 4 of us 

- Additional comments: we went here around 11am and we didn't have to wait but once we got out there was a huge line so I suggest coming early if you don't want to wait because it's not worth waiting for.",3/16/18 16:23

We stumbled onto this place after one of my friends from CA read the reviews. She is a seafood person and really loves oysters and crawfish. 

While waiting outside, the waiters would come out and ask if anyone wants to sit at the bar. Seeing how it's all the same, and you get the same services, if not more attention, we decided to skip the line and head to the bar. 

Upon sitting down, we looked at the menu's and noticed the prices of the oysters. Just to be clear, I do not eat oysters, so I would know nothing about them. My friend on the other hand, she's an oyster maniac. She gushed about the prices of the oysters and how affordable (and reasonably cheap compared to CA). We ordered a dozen Fresh, Ice Cold oysters and half a dozen Chargrilled Oysters. We also ordered the New Orleans Medley and the Acme ""10 Napkin Roast Beef"" po-boy sandwich. 

Once again, to emphasize, I do not eat oysters. When the dozen raw cold, gray, weird looking, yet fresh (described by my friend) came out, I did not want to touch it. Therefore I can not comment on that. But in the words of my friend, ""They were DELICIOUS!"" She said she would recommend them for all the oysters eaters out there. 

The Chargrilled Oysters on the other hand, that I could eat. I tried one of them, and they were DELICIOUS as well. This coming from one who does not eat oysters. They were flavored with seasonings and had some cheese melted onto the shells. This I would recommend, probably the dozen or so. But I believe that oysters are better eaten raw. 

The New Orleans Medley was what you expect in New Orleans. It had the gumbo and jambalaya, as well as beans and a sausage. All 3 of us sampled into each portion. The seafood gumbo was decent. Really watery, which I was told that is not how real gumbo should be (someone please clarify for me). The jambalaya was really good. It was well prepared and is what you would expect as jambalaya. 

The Acme ""10 Napkin Roast Beef"" po-boy sandwich is fairly large, so be careful. We all divvied it up and their responses were ""This is really good"" and ""Soft and tender"". I would have to agree with them. This was my main course, as I do not eat raw oysters, so a portion of that was allocated to the remaining two. 

Overall, I would recommend this place. One would have to either get here during off hours to miss the line, or just request for the bar seats. Either way, a good place to eat in New Orleans.",8/10/09 14:22

So on Friday night we decided to head there for dinner. Now, I'm not a big oyster fan but they assured me that charbroiled these little balls of slime are the best thing ever. 

We got there and saw a huge line out the door. It was cold, 40something degrees and I was not dressed for the weather. My husband and I pointed out all sorts of nearby places that didn't have a line but they were adamant, it was Acme or bust. So we waited for about 45 minutes while I plotted grabbing a trash can and starting a fire to un-numb my hands. We were finally seated and ordered two dozen charbroiled oysters for an appetizer for the table.  

They were good, don't get me wrong. On bread with a bit of the green Tabasco sauce? I actually enjoyed oysters for the first time in my life. Now, were they worth freezing my butt off for 45 minutes? Hell no. 

I followed them up with the New Orleans Medley platter which contained red beans and rice, gumbo, jambalaya, and sausage. It was all very tasty (the jambalaya especially so) and the bread pudding desert was rich and delicious.

I have been back here and to the location in Metairie quite a few times and have never been disappointed.  The po-boys are acceptable and the fish specials are always good.

Even half-sized raw oysters are priced at $3.5 per oyster in Los Angeles... I have been to ACME three times, and I enjoyed it EVERY SINGLE time. Since the wait is usually very long, we would always like to make our wait well worth..here is a list of things we ordered for my boyfriend and myself just the two of us: 2 pounds of boiled crawfish; 1 dozen of fresh oyster; 2 dozens of char-grilled oyster; one pull-boy; one Jambalaya; one gumbo; and one rootbeer float. And yes, we finished them all in no time, so you should know how amazing they are! 

Since lots of people have commented on the oysters and the pull-boys, I feel obligated to say something about the rootbeer float, definitely the best rootbear float I have ever had in my life, and it goes so well with the spiciness of the cajun food.  

I still dream about their char-grilled oysters and hope one day I will be able to find something comparable in Los Angeles....So far, none of the places that claim they can do char-grilled oysters have come even close to what I have had in ACME.

The oysters we ordered were burnt and didn't seemed to be cleaned properly because there was sand within each bite. They were also a bit overcooked so we were really unimpressed.

Second, the char-grilled oysters were some of the most delicious things EVER! I polished off a nice dozen of these before moving on to a half dozen raw. 

The sauce for the raw oysters is delicious; the perfect blend of sweet and spice.

After consulting with the guy behind the bar, and my seatmate, I settled on the bread pudding for dessert. Delicious! Served with a nice bourbon and fruit sauce - the perfect end to an amazing meal.

The wait wasn't too long for a party of two, as we were seated at the bar within minutes (there was about 12 folks ahead of us, all larger parties). We sat with Mr. Hollywood, and he was cool cat. He kept the convo going and provided some tips on which stops to hit and where to be a little more vigilant with our surroundings, seeing as we were tourists and all . Nothing wrong with being a tourist - we help the economy, expand our love of culture for that area and as long you're not obnoxious, then we good (don't be that a-hole tourist, anywhere!).  Super friendly service from him and the gals behind the bar. Loved it. Talk about Southern hospitality. 

Now on to the stuff we came for: OYSTERS. Let me say WOW. They were a good size that was not overwhelming with right amount of flavor.  Slurped them right up and ""Hollywood if He could"" kept shucking for us. We also had half a dozen of charred oysters. AMAZING and dripping with buttah and melt in your mouth stuff. Just writing this review is making my mouth water. It's THAT good. And the crawdads? Oh my oh my.....such flavor!! AND they were not the puny itsy bitsy little spider ones. No, no.  They were big enough to enjoy. A pound went too easily between us, so we ordered another. I can easily eat cinco pounds in a sitting, however, we wanted to save our tummies and walk and try other places. It was muy bien. 
Just for comparison, on our last day, we hit the place across the street from Acme and we can say the service and food was night and day. Acme knows what they are doing, food taste wise and service. If you sit at the bar, try to sit with Hollywood. I call him ""Hollywood if he could,"" but he wouldn't, cause he's been shucking for 34 años. Me encanta charler con Señor Hollywood!

The next day, the line at Acme's was more manageable, so we ventured in.  Our gumbo was good, but the grilled oysters were terrible.  Yes, they were bigger than the ones at Felix's, but you simply could not taste the oysters through the excess salt and garlic, and this is coming from a garlic aficionado.

In fact the guy shucking the oysters gave us a few raw oysters while we waited for ours. I must say the raw ones were better. The char grilled was okay. I would comment on the decor but it was too dark, like speakeasy-prohibition days dark. It can be filling. Was it good? Sure. Will I come again? Probably not.

We waited all of about 5 minutes before we were up, they asked if we mind sitting at the oyster bar where they do the actual shucking. We said we did not and were promptly seated. The only complaint I had about where we were sitting was that the ac duct ended right above us and was blowing ice cold air. Also the guy shucking oysters doubled as our waiter which kind of sucks for him. We also figured out why the wait wasn't very long. Service was very prompt and the food was brought out before I could finish half a beer! As a guy who likes no nonsense wait staff, I didn't feel rushed but I could see how others would. I ordered a New Orleans medley which consisted of jambalaya, gumbo(choice of chicken, seafood, or anduillie), beans and rice, and sausage. Everything was very flavorful with good portion sizes.

Wait time (FYI: Wait line starts outside of the restaurant) was around 20 minutes to be seated for the 2 of us (parties of more than 2 had a longer wait time). We got 2 spots at the Oyster bar. Could not have been happier about that. 

Ordered:
1) Half-Dozen Raw Oysters: (These were some of the largest oysters that we have ever had and possibly some of the best tasting ones as well. Very rich.....in fact so good that we got...
2) ANOTHER Half-Dozen Raw Oysters (after we were done with our Crawfish) 
3) 1 pound of Crawfish (each):  (The crawfish were solid. Mix of freshness and peppery goodness. After seeing us attempt to eat our first crawfish of the bunch, one of the Oyster shuckers laughed at us and took us to school on how to properly eat them... suck out the head first, then pop open the body.... we all had a good laugh... and a good meal)

Beers on tap. Bloody Mary's poured strong.

3 solid stars for food, atmosphere and price.  Checked out Acme on the first night of my NOLA visit. On a Wed evening there was about a 15 min wait.

Got the seafood gumbo, crawfish étouffée and fried oyster po' boy.  Gumbo was good but my small cup size portion didn't justify the $6 price tag.  Crawfish étouffée was delicious - good portions of crawfish.  Wished I had foregone the cup of gumbo and got the large étouffée instead.  The po' boy was a good size and had a nice amount of fried oyster (not skimpy how some places can be).  The fried oyster was delicious and the batter was flavorful and wasn't oily or greasy at all.  Service was great!

All in all, it was a good meal on short notice.  Glad I came and enjoyed the food but I wouldn't necessarily say it was a ""must go"" place, but then again,  I didn't have the oysters that everyone raves about.",1/3/13 22:02

We sat at the bar, and our waiter was Curtis - a super cool guy. We ordered the chargrilled oysters, a side of hushpuppies, an order of fried crawfish tails, boo fries, the New Orleans medley, and the bananas fosters cheesecake. 

The chargrilled oysters were so good - great flavor combinations with the herb butter and the cheddar layer on top. Dipping the included bread into the herb butter is DELICIOUS!! A couple of the clams could have been a bit cleaner (I had some pieces of the shell in my bite), so just a word of caution. 

The hushpuppies were SO GOOD - probably the best hushpuppies I've ever had. Make sure to ask for the tarter sauce they have, it doesn't taste like your typical tarter sauce and goes so well with the hushpuppies! Wonderful smell, crunch on the outside, and flavors.

Fried crawfish tails were also delicious and flavorful. Boo fries were SO flavorful with pieces of beef in the gravy. The jambalaya in the New Orleans medley was delicious and so was the andouille sausage. The red beans and rice and gumbo were OK. The bananas fosters cheesecake had a great flavor combo with the banana, caramel, and fosters sauce flavor. Also, it wasn't too sweet!

Curtis was so cool and a wonderful waiter/bartender. He was super cool, and the people sitting next to us at the bar were very friendly.

They have optional bar seating if you want any available seat but they ended up seating us right next to them!! They have to better organize their seating waiting list. 

Well, I soon got my appetite back! I ordered the fish and shrimp platter. I've never had oysters so I figured I'd try it - I orders half a dozen of the char-grilled. Very good - I think it was cooked in garlic and butter. The shrimp and fish were average but since this is my first time trying oysters; I can't really compare.

First off, I promised my self I wouldn't review the char grilled oysters because EVERYONE did and ranted about how amazing they were to the point where I was like ok, is there anything else on the menu? I would never eat a cooked oyster. But after the 30th rave review, my friend (who had similar views on cooked oysters) and I gave in and tried them. Worst case we would flush $10 down the toilet. OH MY GAWD, SO GOOD! So here I am doing what I said I wouldn't do and reviewing the char grilled oysters. Do it, even if you think you don't want to. Because you do.

Secondly, the bloody marys are not as good as everyone says they are. They are drinkable and I had two, but you can get better in the walk-up daiquiri bars on Bourbon & Decatur. It didn't meet the hype.

Thirdly, the Roast Beef Debris Po Boy is amazing along with the red beans and rice and ettoufee.  Did not love the gumbo as it was a bit fishy.

This is not a 4 star restaurant in NOLA, but it is a 4 star Oyster House in my opinion, or at the least, a 4 star Po Boy.  Call it 3.5 if you want, but I am rounding it up.

A negative about this place, as you'll read in many other reviews, is the lack of reservations and space, so you literally stand on line outside.  But don't fret, this is common (oyster house across the street does the same thing).  The line moves pretty quickly, though a lot of large parties come, which tends to slow up the works.  Anyway, there were maybe 8-10 tables in front of us, including a party of 10 or more, but we were seated within 30 minutes.

During that time, we got some kind of blueberry martini (you can't bring in outside drinks, but you can get drinks at the bar while waiting and bring them back outside to the line - you gotta love NOLA).  Those were delicious.  Highly recommended.

I'm not an oyster eater - my girlfriend is - but the purpose of this visit was to get a good po-boy.  She got a 1/2 shrimp 1/2 oyster and loved it.  I got a roast beef po boy.  Essentially, a roast beef sandwich made to look like a po boy.  Kind of made me wonder what makes a po boy a po boy.  Give me some au jus, and this would have been the perfect french dip sandwich.  Regardless, I don't care if this wasn't a po boy in the classic sense - this was an awesome sandwich.  Enjoyed every bite.

The inside is a bit crowded and loud, but its NOLA, so that's what you get.  We were sitting at the oyster bar, so not the most comfortable location, but the inside is lively and pleasant and you can definitely have a good time here and a good meal.  Worth checking out.",4/22/14 16:41

The food is kinda expensive, but I do appreciate that they offer a new Orleans sampler, with rice and beans, sausage, your choice of chicken and sausage or seafood gumbo (the chicken and sausage is more flavorful) and jambalaya. 

The gumbo was served with a bit of rice in the inside and boy was it a flavor bomb. It is absolutely filled with sausage and chicken in every bite, the broth is salty and salty and spicy,almost like a beef stew on steroids.  It's hard for me to judge because new orleans cuisine is definitely one I am not familiar with. I can say that it is delicious though,and that I'm happy that they offered a sampler platter. The chicken was tender, and not overcooked like it often is in chicken soup, and the sausage was full of meety flavor, adding its distinct saltiness to the jumbo. 

Whoa, the Jambaya is salty. Like super salty. It has chopped chicken (which had toughened up into something resembling chunks of pork) and sausage (chopped into small pieces)  in it. And both are flavored strongly enough to stand out from the rice of the jumbo (which is what is super salty).

The beans and rice  are pretty good. Not the best baked beans Ive ever had. Theyre almost like slow cooked red beans in Mexican cooking. Except these are a bit softer, and are simmer with chopped up pork. A nice diversion from the salt heavy dishes. 
The sausage is actually my favorite. Its not super salty, sliced long side and grilled, giving it a nice char. It was meaty, not super salty, almost peppery. Definitely different from any sausage I've had before. Drier, but made up for it with the char, which I liked. 

The chargrilled oysters smelled delicious, but for $11.50 for half a dozen, Im going to go and see if I can find a place cheaper before I come back and splurge. Also, the only ingredients on the chargrilled oysters are according to the man at the bar: garlic butter and romano cheese

This is how you shuck an oyster. Stuck the knife into the hole where the tendon holding the shell is. Pressure that hole until it pops, then cut both the muscles (one on each side) holding the oyster in place. And its so much harder than it looks.

We listened to our Tastebud Tours guide when he warned us against going during any sort of meal hour. (""Go to Felix's across the street"" was his grandfatherly piece of advice.)
And yet my boyfriend and I were still hellbent on having Acme chargrilled oysters before our weekend trip ended.

Saturday was our day of battle. 
We decided to risk getting in line at 6:00 p.m. because our intended 4:30 p.m. time was just too ridiculous and we had other things we wanted to do. My boyfriend and I had just finished watching a three-minute Black Keys video on his phone when the hostess approached us.
""How many?""
""Two.""
She did a double-take.
""Want to sit at the bar?"" 
""Um...YEAH. Of course.""
""Follow me.""

So she led us past the line of hungry, envious people and into Acme, where the restaurant was occupied with tons of people, noise and neon lights galore. We were positively giddy with excitement when suddenly, our hostess stopped short and announced, ""Wait. I lied. We actually have a table for you by the window.""

And THAT was the start of one of the most memorable meals of my 2014 NOLA trip. I waited a total of three minutes to get into one of the most marketed restaurants in (probably) the nation out of pure luck. I've never been so happy to be in a party of two.

Believe the hype, you guys. Those chargrilled suckers are delicious - we ordered a dozen for each of us and they arrived at a reasonable amount of time with the garlic butter and Parmesan cheese still bubbling and popping.

We arrived at 10:45am (this place opens at 11am) on a Saturday morning and there was already a line and we still had to wait.  We weren't really seated until closer to 11:15am.  Just to warn you know, it can be a bit chaotic when lining up.  They only seat you if your entire party is there.  Otherwise, you have to wait in line and they will skip you and seat other people who are there with their entire parties.  It can get crazy when there are huge groups of bachelor parties in front of you.  On top of that, there is no setup for a line.  There were some arguments that broke out and people were upset thinking that they were in line the whole time.  Just be ready for a mess! 

Once seated, they are pretty quick at taking your order and serving you.  We ordered the three dozen Chargrilled Oysters split between six people.  They come smoking hot to your table and bubbly with the melted cheese.  They can be very rich but they are definitely different and different meaning good.  

We also ordered three dozen raw oysters to split as well.  They serve Gulf Oysters which are thick and large.  I'm more used to the smaller varietals and felt that it was a bit too much for me.  I'm still a novice oyster eater but everyone else at the table loved them.  

We also got a soft shell crab platter and fried oyster platter.  By far, our favorite dish was the Fried Oysters.  Those were really really good.  Deep fried, juicy and tasty!  The soft shell crab platter was also another great dish with deep fried soft shell crab, not like the Japanese type of soft shell crab.  This was hearty and big and yummy! 

The gumbo and jambalaya were meh.

Of course you can't go to NOLA and not eat, drink, and be merry and Acme was definitely a great part of this experience.

After waltzing around enjoying the parades, drinking, and having a dang good time....evening came and we wanted real food.  Acme came up as an idea.  They had me at seafood.  Of course there were tons of people in town so there was a line of about 30 feet worth of people to get in.  Ironically, even though we waited an hour outside to get in, the line moved pretty swiftly for the amount of people that were in it. 

The decor of the restaurant was about what i expected for it to be a restaurant in the French Quarter. Nothing to rave about but not a dive by any means.  I don't think people would've cared either way because they were here for one reason just like me....the food! 

We ordered fried crawfish tails and ""Boo Fries"" for appetizers.  Two great choices.  I was a little hesitant on the ""Boo Fries"" simply because it seemed like an odd combination to me.  My friend swore by them though so here we are! The waitress bring them out and there lies this huge plate of fries topped with roast beef gravy and cheese. I'll just say that i'm glad i trusted my friend!  Never lead me wrong...the streak continues.  Get the Boo Fries if you come here!  The Crawfish tails were delicious also and will be a definite choice each time i come here.

I ordered the Fried Fish Platter as my main course.  I was amazed at how much food they give you.  The fish filets are two huge pieces.  There are a tons of fries and I got 4 hushpuppies as my side.

They're served sizzling hot and that just adds to the deliciousness of the oysters. We sat at the bar and the bartender, Curtis, told us not to order a half dozen because if we did, we would regret it. I'm glad we listened because they were so good a half dozen wouldn't suffice. He also told us to pair it with the Tabasco Chipotle, one of the three Tabasco sauces they offered. It added the right amount of kick and flavor to the already delightful oysters. Whatever sauce is served with the oysters pairs well with the bread they serve with the oysters. 

Next up, I tried the crawfish. They weren't that great but you also don't hear people telling you to go hear for this. The crawfish were huge but the flavor wasn't that great and there wasn't much juice in the head. I wouldn't order this here unless you desperately want crawfish like I did. 

The sides... for the sides I ordered red beans and rice and jambalaya. They were good but nothing to brag about. 

The wait... the wait is something serious during dinner time. Don't let this deter you. Experience the goodness of the oysters. This restaurant is small like many others in the area.

So While working up in Hattiesburg, MS. A customer recommended this place. He was spot on and I had remembered reading about it on Yelp. It was AWSOME. 

It is hole in the wall literally. Pretty basic, I walk to the place and see a line that seems like a mile and  a half long at 9:30pm. As I walk past,  I notice 2 seats at bar open. I go to walk In and a customer says you better get permission before sitting down.

This is the place to check out when in NOLA!!!!

Line was out the door. I thought it would be an hour long wait by looking at the line. Talked to the organized host and he said he could seat 2 (keep in mind we were willing to eat at the bar or table) within 8-10mins.  I told him I called him bluff.  Sure enough we were sitting within 8mins. 

We were seated at the bar in front of our server/chef. It was entertaining to see him work his magic. He could interact while cracking and preparing the oysters.  

We decided to try their flavorful, buttery, parmesan chard fired oysters, gumbo and oyster shooters.  Whether you had an oyster shooter before or not, you have to try Acme's. Highly recommend joining the club ;-P

NOTE: If you have a fellow diner who has a SHELLFISH ALLERGY, this IS the place to go! Especially if you love seafood yourself! They have an AMAZING roast beef Po-boy here and the BOO FRIES are INCREDIBLE. Boo Fries by the way are an appetizer of fresh cut fries covered in cheese and roast beef gravy and the dish could be a total meal. 

The raw oysters on the half shell are a bit pricey but they are FRESH and HUGE! The same goes for the Po-Boy sandwiches as the portions here are generous. If you are willing to eat at the bar you can eat quicker here and they will make anything you want custom to order if it is not on the menu. I wanted a plate of some fried oysters ONLY and they made that for me too.  

They also carry the latest seasonal version of any ABITA beer and the kegs are fresh and the taps are clean! (You can taste the difference too!). For the those unfamiliar with Abita Beers, you really can't go wrong on any of them. AndyGator goes great with seafood and the next time they make Mardi Gras Bock I am considering a commando style raid on the brewery to steal all of the kegs. :-) 

Oh yeah..one more thing that is a biggie: The place is CLEAN! The staff busts their ass and they get your food to you FAST! Don't let a long line outside scare you away because it moves pretty fast. At least it did the night I was there. 

NOTE: These are GOOD people that operate this place who do their best to make sure everything is awesome. Don't act like a pushy, jackass tourist here. You ain't in NYC! This ain't the Bronx and you don't have to start an argument just because you wanted something extra. Just ask politely and you will have it. It's called ""Southern Hospitality"" and IF you have the grace and breeding to see it, your ""cup shall runneth over"".

I never liked cooked oysters before, but decided to give it a try because my friends raved about it.  I initially planned to order just half a dozen of the chargrilled oysters and half a dozen of raw oysters.  However, my friend convinced me that I can have raw oysters anywhere, but chargrilled oysters were a specialty of Acme.  Glad I followed her advice!

First of all, when the waiters delivered the chargrilled oysters to the table, I was fascinated to see that the oysters are still sizzling, such a beautiful sight to behold :)  I was worried that the oysters would be too buttery and cheesy that they would lose their brininess.  Even though it was true that oysters lost their ""oyster-ness"", i.e. the brininess, the satiny texture and the taste of sea, it didn't matter because that butter sauce was amazingggggg.  I was slurping down these babies at a superhuman speed, and can totally understand how someone can eat 14 dozens of them in one sitting (according to Acme's wall of fame).  I was sharing a dozen with my guy and we finished within 5 minutes.  We looked at each other, and wordlessly decided that we need another dozen. I also have to mention the bread, it was the perfect delivery system for that delicious butter sauce.  Words cannot describe how happy I was eating them.

We also tried the New Orleans Medley and a side of potato salad.  Both were good, but paled in comparison to those oysters.  I really wanted to come back and get two more dozens of oysters before we left NOLA, unfortunately we ran out of time.  This is a definite stop if you are in NOLA, my friends who weren't big fans of oysters became a convert when they tried the chargrilled oysters.

I've already had char grilled oysters at two other restaurants before coming here, the oysters are decent but definitely didn't stand out from the pack. And that's where the good stuff ended.

I was extremely looking forward to its Seafood Etouffe and what I was served was no where near what I expected. The so called ""seasoned seafood"" turned out to be a handful of small frozen shrimp available at most grocery stores. And the gravy tasted just like normal gravy one would have for breakfast biscuit or even mashed potatoes... 

Then the jambalaya. We only ordered a side size and the thing came already looking kinda unfresh. The first scoop confirmed it. Not only did the jambalaya tasted mushy but it was cold! We told a staff and he said he was going to get us a hotter one. Ha turns out they just microwaved it for maybe like 1 min or something. Doesn't change the fact that it was awful jambayala. 

We also ordered onion ring because my girlfriend came here two years ago and was very impressed with their onion ring. Well to say the least the breading tasted very dry and it felt like those onion rings were fried a long time ago and were just left out there.. 

We were so dissatisfied and eventually the manager came. I mean one would probably expect a manager of a well known restaurant in the area to be really serious about these complaints about the food quality. But this manager straight up told me that he would take those off of my check and simply left... I was left in shock. Seriously it felt like he didn't give a damn about what I have to say about their food and was sending the message that ""it's cool if you don't like it, we have a line waiting outside anyway"" I don't know how a restaurant that doesn't take customer complaint about food quality seriously can keep being successful... 

I'll just leave it here - there are absolutely better options for seafood around the area if that's what you are coming to NOLA for. Acme DOES NOT live up to its popularity and 4 star review on Yelp imo.",12/22/16 3:51

I wanted to try a selection of what they have to offer, so I got a half dozen of the chargrilled oysters and a meal combo that included half a shrimp po'boy and a side of jambalaya.  I'm not a big fan of oysters, but you can't go wrong when they're chargrilled and covered with butter and cheese, I almost wished I got the full dozen.  The combo meal was also great, the po'boy was delicious with warm, flakey bread, but the jambalaya stole the show.  As much as I enjoyed my meal, I kind of regretted not getting the jambalaya as my full entree.

Overall, I had an excellent meal at Acme Oyster House, but they do fall prey to much of the same issues I've had at other restaurants in the area.

While most people come here to try the oysters, I actually came here because I was told they have some amazing po boys here. I tried the soft shell crab po boy, which comes with a side of fries. Despite the large and awkward shape of the crab pieces, it's actually not hard to hold all of it into a sandwich, and tastes really great when dressed.

Service could be better at the door. They seem to be kinda rude to the people who are waiting in line because tourists always look for ways to just walk in and take a seat. Service inside is really fast and really nice though.

we decided to order:
- chargrilled oysters (full dozen) $19.99.  this comes with a side.  we chose gumbo.  the gumbo was good but we liked the jambalaya more.

- side of jambalaya $3.99 - great, great jambalaya.  bold flavor and not soggy.  we were fans.

the oysters.  no, we didn't do the raw ones.  just because we felt like we could get raw oysters anywhere.  (you probably disagree)  what we did want to try were the chargrilled oysters.  we wanted to know what the hype was all about!

they come out hot. as in you should wait a sec before diving in.  they are pretty special.  i have no idea what makes them so delicious... there is no description on their menu!  the only thing i can offer is that there is lots of butter, white wine and cheese.

FOOD:  delicious!  there is a reason why this place has been around for 100 years... their gem-chargrilled oysters.

SERVICE:  quick.  wouldn't say we received the best service but they are trying to churn people outta here so it is understandable.

AMBIENCE:  this place is a lot bigger than i anticipated.  picnic-like looking tables. casual setting with an oyster bar.  we would have loved to be seated at the oyster bar but were unable to secure seats during either visit.

The raw oysters are so flavorful! Way more so than the asian buffet raw oysters I usually get in Atlanta.

Oysters here seemed to be slightly bigger than ones I had at other New Orleans restaurants. 

The etouffee is very incredible. The sauce is so light but very satisfying. Get the fried crawfish tails!

The veggie burger is really flavorful. If I needed more food to go with my oysters, I wouldn't hesitate to reorder the Acme veggie burger.

Bread pudding was lovely; sweet but not overly so.

I did not enjoy the crab cakes here and do not recommend them. Needed more spice.

----------------------

The wait outside is usually 5-10 minutes depending on your group's size. If you need to seat a party of 6+, be prepared to stand there waiting.

Staff is friendly but forgetful, often needing reminding of little things like refills or sauces. The servers lack attention to detail (not bringing out plates, taking utensils and not leaving new ones) and they seem rushed when you do manage to flag them down.

Food is quite good, and this would earn 4+ stars alone. Their chargrilled oysters really are worth the wait, and even their strong plate options are worth exploring.
