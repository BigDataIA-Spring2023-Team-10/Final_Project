The service was very good and I wasn't waiting long for my order to arrive. I ordered the cinnamon swirl pancakes which were extremely rich, but very, very tasty. When it was time to leave, the server gave me a to-go cup for my coffee which I thought was very thoughtful.

Nice atmosphere and excellent breakfast!",2017-02-09 14:54:46

Neither of us was impressed with the food. It cost twice as much as the breakfast we had at Majoria's Commerce yesterday, but not nearly as good. My dish was catfish with poached eggs. It had Tasso in it and I didn't realize that was ham until I got my order. When I noticed it and told my waiter, he asked if I'd like something else. I asked for the same dish without ham. He was very polite about the ordeal and insisted many people made that mistake of not realizing it was ham. I got a new dish, but seemed like the kitchen just took the ham out of my old dish cause I had taken a tiny piece of the catfish before noticing the ham and realized that same piece of catfish was on my ""New"" dish. The waiter was super polite and professional. That was as the highlight of the trip.",2015-04-01 14:19:54
J9RipJbSTnhO6fea7DyFDw,r_irKyOWcv1stkcab6ycqg,oBNrLz4EDhiscSlbOl8uAw,4,3,0,0,"The Ruby Slipper opened post-Katrina with Oz-inspiration, ""there is no place like home."" The restauranteurs returned to their wrecked city and started it up. 

The decor and atmosphere will make you think the place must have been open longer, y'know, one of those ancient places you find in New Orleans that has been open since the 1800's. Classic southern diner. 

The food is a southern diner style. What's that mean? All of the classics are here, but with a bit of southern twist. You can get an egg's Benedict with pulled pork instead of ham, for instance. Egg's Florentine can be made with collard greens. The food is rich and delicious, in a city known for rich and delicious food. 

A few standouts. The eggs Blackstone is a wonderful, sensible breakfast. It is just on this side of sane on a scale of ""how insanely rich can we make an egg dish."" Delicious. 

The banana's Foster French toast is a decadent, sweet breakfast splurge. It is almost too, too sweet. 

They make a very nice latte. 

You will wait 20-30 minutes probably. It will be worth it.",2015-02-16 16:21:03

As we are ordering, the waitress mutters ""Jesus Christ"" under her breath. Very unaccommodating for swapping sides for the low carb eaters at our table, offering no alternative for fries and fruit. She would ask ""Is everything alright"" and ""Do you need anything else"" without actually stopping at our table. She charged us for every little thing, i.e. sour cream, instead of trying to make up for her bad attitude. The food was subpar, poorly seasoned, and dressed (with condiments) inadequately. We didn't even have the appropriate utensils for the food we ordered, i.e. no spoon for a side of grits.

Line was long but it moved fairly fast.  The host was very accommodating when I told him we were a party of 7.  First he suggested we split into 4 and 3, which given how crowded the place was and how hungry we were, was fine.  Host asked if this was special occasion, I shared we were visiting from Philadelphia to celebrate bachelorette style.  When our turn came up for seating, host surprised us with being able to seat all 7 of us at a table.  Kudos!! 

Now food: to die for. Simple.  Just some of the items in our order included oatmeal raisin pancake (delicious and moist, syrup not needed really), fried green tomatoes (fabulous, the remoulade was delicious), bananas foster french toast (yes, with french bread; heavenly combo of plentiful bananas, raisins, hint of rum, and not-too-soggy bread), mushroom omelette with brie (such a meltingly savory combo), and shrimp grits (perfect texture for grits, fab flavor for cajun shrimp). 

Coffee: very nice quality, not watery weak, not heavily burnt, just perfect. 

I give 5 stars for absolutely perfect in all areas.  This was close, very close.  Only thing is that servers seemed a little rushed, confused, and busy.  I'm not saying service was terrible, it was not.  It just could have  been a tad better organized/attentive.  The host and the food more than made up for that though!",2012-04-28 13:42:11

Because of this, I knew I had to pay them a visit to see if the ""shoe"" fits and it certainly does!

----The Food----
Eggs Cochon ($13.00)- This dish was a dream, mainly because of the pork! Noted as their signature item, it's an eggs benedict with slow cooked, apple braised pork stacked on homemade buttermilk biscuits, topped with large poached eggs, and drizzled with hollandaise sauce.  I could eat that tender, flavorful pork all day.  While this plate is one of my favorite dishes in NOLA, I felt the thick hollandaise sauce could've used more kick/flavor.  Thankfully, the perfectly poached eggs provided some yolk to amplify the taste.  The buttermilk biscuits are admittedly better than Stanley's too.

Bananas Foster Pain Perdu ($11.00)- I commend The Ruby Slipper Cafe for trying to bring a different element to this popular dish by using actual french baguette and cutting it in odd/unique fashion to form their french toast on this plate.   However, I feel it took away from the texture of french toast that I prefer.  While it was still enjoyable, I felt myself quickly overwhelmed at meals end.  The Banana Foster at Stanley wins in this battle.  This plate is also served with rum flambeed bananas, raisins, and applewood bacon which all overshadowed the french toast, easily.  

Cheese grits ($3.25)- Who doesn't like cheese grits?! 
----
Conclusion: With the fun, charming atmosphere and vast, affordable brunch menu, I'd recommend this spot as a must-visit in NOLA--ESPECIALLY for their Eggs Cochon!

-Accepts credit card

We ordered two benedicts, the eggs cochon (pork debris) and chicken st. charles (fried chicken). While the egg cochon benedict was good, the fried chicken on the st charles benedict was very disappointing. It was not hot, dry, and flavorless. We had fried chicken every day on our trip to NOLA, and while this was mainly a benedict dish, it had the worst fried chicken we had on this trip.

Another thing that was disappointing was that we didn't get our utensils right away; we got them after getting our waiter's attention AFTER having our meals sent to us. Our waiter was nice and all, but missing utensils is such a sad feeling especially when food is right in front of us, seriously!

I like the ambiance, I like decor, the staff was very friendly, anyone who walked past me spoke which was awesome. I love when restaurants make me feel like i'm shopping in a department or boutique. 

I ordered the French Toast, pork sausage, and stone ground grits. I asked the host early on what the kitchen time was so I could hurry back to my office, she said 15 minutes  I waited for 30. I saw people who arrived well after I did get their food first. I was even a lil more perturbed that the bartender I ordered with kept eyeing me but never walked over to reassure me that my food was on its way or offer me a drink or even see if i wanted one. He failed at up-selling me. Finally my food came and then he asked if there was anything I needed. UH NO. I've wasted 30 minutes of my life I'll never get back and I'm in too much of a rush to order anything else, even a drink, on the chance I could be waiting here another 30 minutes. **rolls eyes. 

I walked back to my office mumbling ""this sh** better be worth 30 minutes."" 

It was not. 

My french toast wasn't finished cooking, they were really wet all over and seemed to only be cooked on one side. The sausage was fine but didn't really have any flavor. And the stone ground grits i just don't prefer. I don't believe anything was wrong with them. 

I really didn't have time to turn around to get my French Toast redone because I had already waited so long.

The only thing good about the pain perdu was that they actually used french bread. It was bone dry on half, and not what I would call a custard on the other side. The ""bananas foster"" sauce was bland. My friend's French toast was dry but the peanut butter filling and chocolate sauce topping was good, so that slightly made up for it. I can give them that the service and bacon was really good! The table next to us was complaining amongst each other about their food as well.

The Bourbon Milk Punch and Bloody Mary are both well made with a solid kick and great flavor",2014-03-15 18:03:51

What a different experience! Our waitress, Mary, was AMAZING. So sweet, friendly, and fast too! The food was better - every single one of us liked our meal more!! One got the French toast of the day (omg amazing). I got the vegetarian omelet and it was outstanding. The grits here weren't as good as at the other location (weird, right?) but everything else was better. One of our coffee cups was dirty inside (kind of gross), but Mary brought a new cup of coffee right away. Such a good meal and a SUPER COOL restaurant. The vintage U shaped bar is stunning and the decor is so much fun. I didn't like the shared booths at the other location; it was nice to have our own table at this spot.

I was glad it didn't feel like a tourist haven or trap, whichever you prefer, as it seemed locals and tourists dine side-by-side here. Aside from the wait, all was smooth, our service was good (fast) and friendly. We had bloody marys and lynchburg lemonades which were strong and good. 

I found the food to be about average for a brunch spot. Maybe I am spoiled because I live in Chicago and we brunch like tomorrow will never come, but I thought the food was just GOOD, not GREAT. I would have been frustrated if we had to wait more than 30 minutes.

That said, maybe I just didn't get the right thing. I had the cochon Benedict, Hollandaise on the side. Which I am glad for as the Hollandaise here tastes like a heavy cheese sauce. The biscuit was great, tasted homemade as I am sure it was. The pork was moist but I found it a bit too sweet, like apple juice or cider tasting for my own preference. This is what kind of ruined it for me.

That said, I also tried the fried green tomato BLT which was quite yummy.

I think the fact that this food is only worth waiting 30 mins for pretty much sums up my thoughts about the place. Not the worst I've had, but certainly not the best either. I'd recommend it just to say you went, I suppose.",2016-04-23 18:40:25

She sprinted down the street, and just before she reached the truck, the driver saw her, and his eyes widened in fear like a gazelle who sees the lion coming to take it down.

With a mighty battle roar, Danielle leaped up on the running board, opened the driver's door, threw him out onto the muddy streets of New Orleans like so much wet sack of flour, then took up his position. She jammed the truck into reverse, then forward, turning onto the street to careen back toward where starving travelers waited with mouths a-salivatin' for their precious cargo of fresh, tender young Gulf shrimp. 

She only crushed three cars in her path, and as all of them were Smart Cars, it didn't really count. She also took out the elderly couple from Des Moined, but inexplicably, they'd just finished complaining about the food, so no one was troubled.

The shrimp and grits were, as always, excellent.",2017-04-08 23:01:09

yqBeeVG-0BrMT9sdFaKS3A,hSKR5Hn_bKpPkopM_Agv6A,oBNrLz4EDhiscSlbOl8uAw,2,1,0,0,"An impromptu visit because The Store was closed for the holiday and we were going to the taco bar to celebrate our very pregnant coworker who was going out on maternity leave. 

Hostess seemed overwhelmed at our request for a table for 9, but we offered to split into two groups. Then we noticed the tables along the back wall and one of our group asked if we could sit there. After some unnecessary discussion (why should there be a discussion--sitting at adjacent tables in two groups is better than sitting across the room from one another?), we were seated. Our group was the table of 5. Each group had a different server, in case you try to blame the service I will describe on just being an overwhelmed Waiter with a 9 top. 

I was excited looking at the menu, and almost went for breakfast at lunch, but since it was my first visit, I played it safe with the burger, but opted to pay $2 extra for the sweet potato fries since I saw that they came with a side of creole tomato dressing. 

The burger was okay--just a burger, although I was happy to see that it was thoroughly cooked but not burnt. The sweet potato fries were very good--crispy with a slight flaky texture. I asked if they came with some sort of sauce and Waiter offered to bring out some of the dressing. 

The bacon was left off of one co-worker's sandwich; this wasn't addressed with Waiter. Another coworker was served regular fries (kinda meh--seasoning reminded me of Rally's) instead of sweet potato fries. This was addressed with Waiter; he brings her a handful of fries on a plate and says the rest will be out in a minute. They never came, but when she was charged the full $2 for the fries on her bill, I asked Waiter if her fries were coming out soon when she asked for a to go box for the rest of her club sandwich (she's not as confrontational as I am). FYI, she said the club was delicious.

Waiter offered to separate the checks, which was fine with us. We each gave him a card, and when he brought them back, he set them all in a pile in a wet spot on the table, with a ""Thanks, guys,"" and walked off. At this point, the lunch rush had leveled off, and there were many empty tables--it wouldn't have been impossible for him to take an extra 30 seconds with our table. We were left to sift through the wet receipts and credit cards to figure out what belonged to who. I tipped less than 20%, which I NEVER do--I can almost always rationalize poor service, but today, not so much. 

I'd heard really good things about the food at this place, and would have been excited to go back and try the breakfast menu.  I can't say that service was so bad that I would never go back there if someone else wanted to eat there, but it doesn't get a recommendation from me.",2011-06-30 19:22:36

The staff at the host/hostest stand were not friendly, but at least were not rude. Except for Matt. Matt looked extremely miserable, almost like it was painful to be there.  I tried to be friendly and make conversation, and he responded to both questions I asked with very cute, one word answers, and no smile, or even a hint of a personality. My friend and I were seated by the front door, and it was cold and breezy. Another table opened up, away from the entry, so we asked a random staff member if we could move. That staff member asked grumpy Matt, who rolled his eyes, shook is head, and said ""no, we don't do that"". A few minutes later, we asked our kind and friendly server Roy the same questions, and he replied ""sure, no problem"", and we moved. 

When Matt walked over and saw we had moved, he got visibily frustrated and huffed off. 

Anyway, the food was pretty good.  One of our orders didn't come out correctly, but we didn't complain.

Wait was tolerable, they were turnin and burnin. Had a Bloody Mary to kick off the day, and it was very spicy, and had pickled green beans as a garnish (a first for me). 

Table ordered French toast pain perdu, spinach bacon and Swiss omelet with deep fried potatoes, corned beef bennies, shrimp and grits. 

The biscuits were epic in size and flavor, kinda crusty, crispy but very soft inside. 

The shrimp and grits were good, not fabulous, lacked some basic seasoning and needed something else. Not sure. It wasn't horrible, just not memorable. I also ordered the corned beef hash side, fresh, good, again lacked some seasoning or that one ingredient that makes you go WOW. The horseradish cream sauce I ordered with it (one of the 'Bennie' ingredients) made it, that and the bottom half of the epic biscuit. The top half was munched with butter and grape jelly. Too bad they didn't have some sort of home made jam or marmalade.

I tasted the French toast, it was made with French bread (like po boy bread I guess), very good. Boss finished her omelet, the potatoes were reported as really good by number one son, I did not partake. They were small, maybe new or red potatoes that were halved or quartered and fried to a dark golden brown then had some sort of magic seasoning. The omelet was fried well in a thick circle of eggyness, then folded over. I like mine very thin like a crepe, but I didn't order it, so who cares?

Solid choice for breakfast, and they also have brunch and lunch items but our krewe did not go there. Portion size is large. No cafe au lait, but they had steamed milk? That confused me. The server didn't seem to know what I was asking for on that one. For some reason he did not charge for coffee and tea and chased us down outside when they lost one of the signed receipts during busing. We liked how a larger party could pay by the seat (put seats 1,4, and 6 on this card, and the rest on that one).  Very convenient. We had 6 people, gratuity was added for us.

I answered the survey questions and they do have two televisions at this location, the one I noticed was tuned to CNN, no way you could have heard it in this place when we were there. Probably convenient for the business types' weekday breakfast routine.",2014-03-16 08:13:37

Food:
It was bomb. Point blank period. I got the creole and pork eggs Benedict and we split a blueberry pancake. The eggs were perfectly poached and the sauce was so creamy and flavorful. The pancake was perfectly sweet and fluffy, not overdone on the edges, and we absolutely devoured it. I got a traditional mimosa which wasn't super stellar. It was good just nothing to rave about. I did see a few people with the house special mimosa which seemed to be popular- maybe give that one a shot instead. 

Atmosphere:
Casual and bustling for sure. They had the floor to ceiling window/doors which are ever present in this city. So it had a nice charm to it. It was definitely busy for a Saturday brunch however. I STRONGLY recommend using the no wait app to call ahead for you. Otherwise you may have a 1.5+ hour wait. We only stood outside for maybe 15 minutes since we took that option. 

Overall I highly recommend this brunch spot. The locals and tourists alike enjoy it, so don't miss out on some amazing Nola brunch!",2018-06-09 16:31:38

Ambiance and service- it's a fun lively service. We didn't have a wait. The staff were fast and very friendly. 

Food: 
Banana Fosters French toast- if you're looking to treat yourself, this is your treat. The French toast was flavorful. The bread was a little soggy but likely because it was sitting in a pool of syrup. The bananas and raisins compliment it well. The best part was the apple wood smoked bacon which among the best bacon I've had, thick, flavorful, and the perfect crispness

They let you mix and match the eggs benedicts. I had the eggs Cochon - deliciously juicy pork, and the st. Charles- fried chicken. The pork was really flavorful and was surprisingly good with the poached egg.

I popped in for a late breakfast early lunch. 

I was alone so I was seated almost immediately 

The place was fairly busy. Didn't seem like any of the staff were overwhelmed. 

Now maybe I ordered the wrong dish but for a place with a 4+star rating I was expecting something of significance. 

I ordered the 3 little pig omelette. 

Let's start with it took just about 25min to get served...  it's an omelette. 

It was an very uninspired dish (see photo). 

Simple little omelette. Couple pieces of sausage (mainly) and a sprinkle of bacon and ham....  apparently those 3 little pigs are on house arrest because only a couple came to my plate. 

With the entree I got a couple pieces of fruit and a dense (not flaky) biscuit. 

The best part of the dish was the whipped butter with some syrup on it...  that's a little disappointing that that's the highlight. 

And at the end the worst part. Sitting at the bar and watching two little cockroaches run around the underside of the bar...  definitely not the most appetizing thing to see but with a restaurant in this location with the door always open you have to assume there will be little critters running around.",2018-08-14 16:42:29

I was shocked to see so many people waiting for the opportunity to dine, but luckily the waitlist helps you time your arrival a bit better. The wait was about 58-65 mins on a Saturday morning, so we arrived close to the 60 min mark. We had to wait a bit longer to be seated, but luckily the weather held up. They have a couple benches to sit outside while you wait and they come out to call names when it's time to be seated. 

As far as seating, they have patio // outdoor seating, as well as plenty of space indoors. The service is realitvely fast and friendly. Our waitress was efficient and gave good recommendations. To me, the menu is standard, but all of the brunch options were covered for sure. My friends really enjoyed the special which was some type of seafood eggs benedict. I tried bbq shrimp and grits, but don't be alarmed, there's no bbq sauce on it. I can't say it was the best shrimp and grits I've had, but it was okay. I asked for a side of whatever sauce they put on the catfish and grits, and enjoyed that flavor much more! It also came with a massive biscuit, which I'm sure is a great option to coat your stomach before hitting Bourbon st.

I love breakfast - I could eat it four or five times a day, and the wife-unit loves various egg dishes - so this place seemed right up our alley.  But they missed...

Atmosphere: Some neat extras on the wall, but the most interesting was mostly hidden by the server access to the kitchen.  Overall very loud since it is just one huge open area with no sound baffles.

Service: We sat at the bar and had a friendly (although loud) conversation with the bar tender. Minor complaint in this department was the wife finished her coffee drink shortly after the food was delivered and they didn't ask if she wanted more / anything else. Perhaps we should have made more eye contact while eating.

Cost: Reasonable, if it'd been cooked better...

Food: The most important part, and the reason it's 2 stars.  Sorry for all the text, I promise I'm a man of few words - so you know they're required...

Wife-unit's Eggs Cochon: overall she enjoyed them, but noted a few things regarding her plate: 1. there wasn't enough sauce, 2. her bacon wasn't crispy (as requested), 3. the egg was almost cold (even sitting on top of warm meat).  You can see from the pics here on Yelp the inconsistency in the sauce... some have quite a bit, others very little.

My ""cheesecake"" french toast: unfortunately worse.  Actually, again you don't have to look any further than the pictures right here on Yelp of the french toast or pancakes to again see how inconsistently they are cooked.  Mine was basically burned on one side of the bread (even darker than any of the pictures I can find posted here), and the other side was completely uncooked.  Maybe they thought it would even out? ;-)  I realize they're kinda making a sandwich with the ""filling"" between two pieces of french toast, but it ends up being too soggy if they don't fry both sides of the toast.

The Peacemaker (Chacon and St.Charles)- I knew the St.Charles was going to be fantastic, but it exceeded my expectations. The egg was poached perfectly and the chicken was tender and sooo flavorful. The Chacon surprised me, I wasn't sure how good the pork would be, but it was DELICIOUS moist and flavorful. They will allow you to change the egg to fried if you don't want it poached. 
The shrimp and grits- really good, it has a lot of flavor and the rosemary adds a really nice touch.

It's a biscuit split in 2 both sides have chicken fried chicken breasts, poached eggs (I got mine scrambled), topped with gravy.  The eggs were great.  The chicken had a saltier style breading, which I like, but if you're sensitive to salt, maybe not for you.  The biscuit was good, but I would have enjoyed it a little softer.  With the chicken being crispy, it would be nice to have it surrounded by softer items.  However, I enjoyed the breakfast.  I felt rejuvenated after eating it.  Service was great.  You won't get 5 star service in a place like this.  What you should expect is fast and courteous service.  You will get that here.  The team seems comfortable with high volume, and work as a team.

Once you enter and get seated, the place has a busy and upbeat vibe. The staff is helpful to each other, assisting with table needs. Our waitress was a lovely woman who spoke highly of various menu items. I ordered the bacon-infused Bloody Mary to start because who doesn't want vodka that has had applewood smoked bacon sitting in it for 5 days?! The cocktail had a that smoky flavor from the bacon with a nice heat! It was garnished with lemon, lime, olive, and pickled green beans-oh yeah, and bacon, too! I ordered the 3 Little Pigs omelette (ham, bacon, sausage) with a side of breakfast potatoes. I also ordered a side of ""candy bacon"" which is applewood smoked bacon that is topped with brown sugar and baked. It was delicious! I guess you could say I had a Bacony Breakfast!

Details :

Here are some tips.

1) Use the NoWait App to add your name to the waitlist remotely. It works wonders! My boyfriend and I added our name, walked 30 minutes from our Airbnb to Ruby Slipper and were next in line to be seated right when we arrived.

2) Order the Southern Breakfast ($9) if you want some variety on the plate. The biscuit was so perfectly fluffy with buttery flakey goodness. Plus you get to try a fried green tomato and grits (something relatively new for a Californian like me).

3) The Bananas Foster ($11) is decadent and absolutely worth trying! The bread is outstanding alone, and the flambéed bananas and raisins complete the package. My boyfriend ordered it and we ended up sampling the savory from my Southern spread and the sweet from his.

I thought the quality of the food matched the prices. Our server was very friendly and attentive, despite the restaurant being packed. 

Give Ruby Slipper a try! Just be sure to use that app.",2016-04-01 05:52:25

Not that you have a choice but sit inside if you can. The lady calling out names on this particular day had a very loud voice and she called out names like every minute or two. Really should invest in a pager/buzzer system.

Anyway, got there Sunday around 10 am and waited maybe half an hour. As busy as it was, food service was actually not bad. However, it took forever to get our drinks before the meal at the walkup bar area and it took forever for me to get my check due to a POS malfunction. But hey, once we got the bloody marys, we were all happy. They were pretty good too. 

I got the eggs coubion which was a nice-sized portion and good. Nicely poached eggs, tasty catfish strips, sausage and other additions (wilted spinach, artichoke, etc). All on top of some baguette pieces which was a lot of bread but soaked up the egg as designed. I thought the seasoning was fine on my dish. Not too heavy either.

That's it. That's the review. The 2 others in our party had other food which I'm sure was good but I didn't try it so there you have it. If it sucked they would have said something. I'm sure the rest of their food is good but it's a busy place for weekend brunch so don't be shocked about what you're getting yourself into.

Our table was right by the door, almost touching everyone else who was waiting in line to be seated and going in and out of the door. While our server was pretty nice, we rarely saw her. 

They have an app to get ""in line,"" so we tried to do that. We thought we would give it another chance since it had the best reviews and we thought our first experience might have been a fluke.  They open at 8 and you can't use the app until 8 when they open. At that time, it said there was no wait. We were 2 minutes away and by the time we got there, they suddenly had a 30-45 minute wait. Apparently, they don't start taking names for the list until after they have filled the entire restaurant for the first time. Which means it tells you they have no wait but there is a line around the corner. And if you are in line you still might not get a seat if there are enough people in front of you. I asked the hostess and manager why they didn't post on the app that they had a full restaurant line so we could get in line on the app and know we would have to wait 30 minutes and the response was that that's the way they do it.

The service here is excellent, and I noticed that they keep a smile on their face even with annoying travelers asking many questions and rambling on about things. I could never do that, especially while working.

The food was really good. I wish I had been more hungry while I was there, since I didn't come close to finishing my breakfast. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was their fried green tomato. It was different than I've had in the past... it was expectedly crunchy on the outside, but the inside was hard as well. Might have just been the one I had, though.

QrDkHy5Yhqp73ZHx9KXlIg,Vzp9gtV2SgBZEOnckCAExg,oBNrLz4EDhiscSlbOl8uAw,3,1,2,1,"Walking around Canal street on the hunt for some food, I stumbled upon this place. It is hard to miss as it is surrounded by a swirling mass of people, as if they were caught in some gravitational pull.

Despite the very long line, I was able to sit at the last seat at the bar (it pays to go solo sometimes). However, once I sat down, service was a little slow, In defense of the waitress, it was at capacity at around 25 people and she was the only person behind the bar. That is a fail on the part of management that couldn't predict a Saturday morning rush.  
 
While waiting, I pulled up Yelp and instantly saw my choice--the Eggs Blackstone. Pretty much eggs Benedict, but on a biscuit. If ever you should see something like this on the menu, get it!

After waiting a good 10 minutes, I got the menu and ordered my coffee. Another 10 minutes pass before actually getting my coffee and being able to order... which ended up breaking my heart--they were OUT OF BACON!!! 

Bacon being the proverbial glue that connects the eggs to the biscuit is an essential component of the Eggs Blackstone. And they didn't have any. Breakfast without bacon is like an earth without water: incapable of sustaining life. Without this, it is just eggs with tomato on some carbs. Unacceptable. In my sorrow, I ordered what appeared to be the closest thing--Eggs Cochon: slow cook pork debris served over an open-faced biscuit, topped with poached eggs and hollandaise.

True to its word, the slow cook pork came slowly. About to eat my hand off and having finished my coffee 5 minutes ago, this beast of a plate appeared before me. I didn't really know what to expect, but what I saw made me think of pulled pork in gravy sloppy joe, with poached eggs and sauce. Hiding beneath this mountain of fat and grease were some carbs in the form of soggy biscuits. While no means bad--and actually good at first--it was a bit much. A bit much for breakfast and a bit much to eat without having my coffee refilled. After putting it away, I finally got my first refill and downed that in a heartbeat. 

Overall, service was crap due to so many people and poor management. I felt bad for the waitress, but still begrudged my lack of coffee. Then for not having bacon, I am sorry. There is no excuse for an established early on Saturday morning to have run out of bacon. Together, this knocks off two stars. The food was food, but not worth the wait to get in, fight to get attention, and disappointment of maybe not having bacon. I'd consider coming back here, but only if it were not busy, which I am not sure happens.

Mon: We ordered Banana Fosters Pain Perdu: which is good but only if you like that kind of thing,  Stuff french toast filled with cheesecake: which basically taste like cheesecake flavor cream cheses between my french toast, chicken st. charles benedicts:  the fried chicken was little dry and lack of flavor and the egg was over cook to my liking. It was not runny at all. Maybe there was not enough sauce cuz i end up using ketchup.  We also had a side of corned beef.  I got to admit that was probably the best corned beef hash I ever had.   It was flavorful and not dry which I liked. It was different because this was the first time i had hash that was just chunks of potatoes. 

Tues:  Since I love the corned beef so much we got the corned beef bennie and french toast batons.  The batons was basically frech toast sticks. It was good maybe becuz it was easy to share and its was crunchy.  The corn beef benedict was on point. Corned beef was amazing and the egg was on point.

Service was great. He was willing to make suggestions which is always nice. We only had one misstep from a small miscommunication; my Bananas Foster was supposed to come with applewood smoked bacon.

Oh my lawd (southern enough?) was this brunch delicious to the point of forcing me to redefine what I find delicious.

Lets start with the bad - not that there is such a thing.  You have to wait to come here.  There are no reservations and there will be a line.  You can't wait inside, either, so not a great place in bad weather.  People mill about on the side walk outside and across the street.  But, even the bad isn't that bad.  I know this wasn't mardi gras or jazz fest, but it was Easter Weekend and it was in between Easter parades (not to go off on a tangent, but you need to visit NOLA on Easter.  It is a trip).  Anyway, we were told a table for 2 would be 30 minutes.  It might have been 40, but not too far off, and based on the crowd, we thought it would be more like 60.  They move it fast.

Its a cute place, nothing too memorable, but bright and pleasant.  Service was great - server was on top of things and friendly.

But the important part was the food.  If I can quote Frank the Tank when he saw Blue in heaven, it was ""glorious.""  Anyway, I got the Eggs Cochon - I was waffling (get it, waffle? brunch? waffling?  I know I know, I'm a riot) between that and the Chicken St. Charles.  The latter has fried chicken, the former has apple braised pork debris.  I almost went with the chicken because I ate lots o' pork this weekend, but in the end, I went with the signature item and am I glad I did.  This came out with what seemed like a mountain of braised, slow cooked, pulled pork on a buttermilk biscuit and 2 perfectly poached eggs.  It was so much wonderful food.  I haven't had a brunch that good since...well, the day before actually at Stanley's...but this was much better than that, and that was great.

And, because I am a piggy and my girlfriend allows me to be a piggy and will participate in my pigginess though in no way in the world am I attributing pigginess to my girlfriend, we also got their bananas fosters french toast.  Never tasted anything like it.  You have to get this - it was so deliciously wonderful (and it came with a side of bacon, so more pork for me!).

They have multiple locations in NOLA but we decided to stop in downtown early in the morning. We caught Lyft and made to the location packed with a waiting line outside. We put in our reservation and left our number. they said they would text us when it was our turn. 
  They had 5 picnic table on their patio which 4 businessmen were sitting at with a server assisting them. My wife approached the hostess and asked if we could sit on the patio for immediate service. she responded yes. She grabbed a couple of menus and sat us on a table. As soon as we sat our server greeted us and asked if we'd like some coffee. We asked if they offered Lattes, she said of course, Can we get two as we look over the menu? she said no problem.  As we looked over the menu we decided on trying a few different benedicts that they are known for. I ordered the Pulled Pork Benedict. My wife ordered the Bacon and chicken benedict. All came out with different hollandaise sauce. 
At the end of the day we both agreed that the pulled pork benedict was better in taste as the pork was so moist. All the benedicts are served on a biscuit not a muffin as it normally would. We also ordered a side of Breakfast potatoes and fried green tomatoes. The potatoes fried and well seasoned. the fried green tomatoes were breaded in a Italian breadcrumbs. not our thing, but I'm sure they sell a lot of those.
  The lattes were smooth and velvety and delish. Overall I would go back and try some different items.",2018-04-17 22:30:21

I was in a tank top and shorts; froze the moment I walked in.  Asked two servers to turn up the A/C but finally i flagged down the manager who was happy to accommodate my request.  Our wait at 11:30 on a Sunday was about 15 minutes.  We had been told 25-30 so this was nice.  Make sure you check in on Yelp as you get 2-4-1 Mimosas!
The restaurant is cute but not over the top.  Three panels in the back talk about the food, the drink, and why they opened (to revitalize after Katrina).  I happened to visit the day before the six-year anniversary of Katrina and basically the whole city made no mention of it really.  No opinion either way on this. 
The food: my table of 4 split the Peanut Butter Oreo pancakes (3) and some of it wasn't finished, only because we were saving room for our orders.  The pancakes were a little doughy (fixed by syrup) but definitely tasted like Oreos.  In fact, huge cookie pieces were evident and yummy.  I tasted no peanut butter.  
I ordered the Eggs Blackstone.  Interesting take on Eggs Benedict but a miss in my opinion.  The server told me as he put down my plate that one of my eggs had broken and they gave me a little dish with a perfectly poached alternative.  However, after removing the broken egg (myself!) and putting the unbroken egg on top of the biscuit, i was in need of more hollandaise sauce.  Requested and served by the time i went to eat the second biscuit.  The taste overall of the blackstone, with applewood smoked bacon and tomato on biscuit instead of muffin, was okay.  The Hollandaise Sauce wasn't anything like what I've had in the past.  It was orange and not very buttery at all.  Two people who were traveling with us but weren't at breakfast with us, ate here about 3 hours after and felt the same about the sauce.  It's served with a small bowl of fruit, which contained about 7 1-inch square pieces of pineapple and honeydew, one strawberry sliced in half, 3 grapes and two small orange slices.  For $13 I would have appreciated a heartier side.  Oh well. I wasn't fulling sickenly full at the end of my meal so i kind of appreciated the fruit after teh fact.  My tablemates commented that their food was fine but not what they expected after hearing reviews from friends.  Service was good and they break out your check by seat #.  I had bottomless cup of coffee because I was so cold and it tasted fine.

The host called my phone at 12:20 asking if we still planned to dine at the rest, I said yes and he told me to come to the front door. My party of 8 stood there for more than 30 min additional waiting to take a seat. We have been sitting here since that time and have yet to eat. We don't have silverware and the waiter didn't even come back to give us an update on the food we ordered.

The ""Eggs Cochon"" benedict was spot on! I'd get it again. My wife had the Bananas foster french toast, it's the reason we came, and it didn't disappoint. There might be better options for bananas foster, but you'll pay a LOT more for it and have to wear a tie while you eat it.

Now, eggs benedict is my favorite breakfast dish, so excuse me if I sound a little fanatical. But this place has so many variations on the classic that we've all come to expect. 

When my wife and I went, I got the Cochon benedict which features a briny pulled pork on a biscuit, topped with the classic poached egg and their delicious hollandaise. The pork was juicy and tender and the flavor paired extremely well with the tangy hollandaise. 

My wife ordered the Chicken St. Charles - basically a fried chicken benedict. I'm not kidding. It was easily the star of the show. A perfectly fried chicken breast served on a biscuit and topped with a poached egg and a pork tasso cream sauce. That tasso cream sauce is OUTRAGEOUS. If you get it, you will love it, and forever be wanting more of it. No joke. My wife was in heaven. And then I had a bite, and I joined her... in heaven. But we were still alive... and on earth.

My sister (a professional waitress) gave very high marks to our server for her performance for being prompt and knowledgeable. I started with a wonderful mimosa that hit the spot and tasted the coffee which was also quite good. Just FYI, the banana fosters french toast is all that it is cracked up to be!!! It is beautifully presented and by far the best french toast I've ever had! The bacon was also delicious! Everyone was happy with their breakfast choices, commenting and all the nice touches, including the refreshing-ness of the multi grain toast served as opposed to the traditional white bread at many breakfast venues.
We were so happy with this place that we ended up coming here again the last morning we were in NOLA. Interestingly enough, you can skirt the high price of the Blackstone ($13) by ordering the breakfast sandwich with poached eggs and a side of hollindaise. ($6.75) You don't get the side of fruit/toast, but you still get full! The waitress the second time around was different and was really pushing the up-sales so it wasn't as pleasant, but the food makes this place worth it. A must eat!

The portions are generous. I ordered the bellini double and my DH had the bacon bloody mary. I had the banana foster French toast. The flavor was nice but the texture wasn't. It was like the bread sat in the  batter too long and maybe they didn't cook it quite long enough. It was almost gelatinous on the inside. The pork corchon my husband ordered was great though.  The pork had a great flavor. I think the ""runniness"" of the poached eggs are hit and miss. One was poached to perfection and the the other was almost solid.

The mimosas were good too, and the service was good. They were quick, but they had to be because the place was PACKED.

The lost star is only because we had to wait two hours to be seated. We were told it would be two hours, but a lot of groups seemed to wander away, so we were worried it'd be less, which is why we stayed the whole time. I'd recommend putting in your name, peacing out for an hour and then coming back. Two hours is a LONG time to hang in the sun while you're hungry.

  My french toast left quite a bit to be desired.  It was okay but the boston creme part of it wasn't very sweet. It just wasn't a standout in the french toast category for me. 
   My wife liked the taste of the shrimp and grits quite a bit but the shrimp were on the tougher side so that was kind of a letdown for her.  It was decently heavy on the stomach entree so that's something to consider.

This restaurant was a super close walk from our hotel down the street. Staff at the hotel recommended this place as a popular breakfast spot, so I'm glad we arrived around 7am.

The food was a little on the pricier side from what I expected, but the portions were really big so I didn't feel so bad afterwards. I got the cheesecake stuffed French toast which was delicious, but there was a weird tart on the side that I didn't really understand and didn't eat. The bread on the French toast was really thick and I felt like there wasn't enough cheesecake in the middle. It was still a yummy meal. I also got a side of the potatoes which were delicious and crispy. I couldn't finish my breakfast, but I was satisfied overall.

We got decent service from our waitress who kept coming by to fill up our waters. She seemed nice.

The wait wasn't long, the hostess was very friendly and complimented my name (bonus points)! We were seated at the bar right next to another couple who had just been sat. The timing seemed a little awkward as we were handled like a group of 4 and not 2 parties of 2. The bartender IDed me and didn't notice it was my birthday. Or if he did there was zero care. Doesn't bother me but I'm not sure if he knew the date/actually verified my age in his head.

The drinks were delicious though, as they should be for $10 a mimosa. The boyfriend ordered a Bloody Mary and it was nice and spicy. I think they pre-made large quantities of mix and it worked soooo much better than zing zang. 

The food!! Was the crowning point of the experience. I ordered the salmon, poached egg, hollandaise with capers on a biscuit and let me tell you, yum! The biscuit tasted house made and the hollandaise was not too lemony, overall I was very impressed.

Seated at the bar, the never-ending blur of activity that turned out to be the bartenders/servers extraordinaire greeted us and immediately made me homesick to move back home to LA. 
And then the morning went due south. While waiting just shy of an hour for our breakfast, we saw and heard our servers get repeatedly jerked around and lied to as they were told our order, and many others for those seated at the bar, were ""on their way,"" ""the very next ticket,"" & ""just waiting on 1 thing."" No food came out for any of us. Then, after visiting with every one that had food and dodging everyone that had been waiting, the manager came to apologize (Good!) and let us know that our food was ""on its way"" and ""the very next ticket"" (No, that's not going to work after the ""almost an hour"" range). We left, mildly hungry, and royally pissed that they treated their staff that way. 
I'd like to think this was a blip on the radar. I've worked as a server and a bartender over several years in the past, and few things suck as much as the BOH making a mistake, not owning up to it, and leaving the servers baffled, standing around, not especially eager or able to help their hangry customers. And then for the MOD to try to keep up the pretense can feel like a punch to the gut. I've heard the food is really good. Maybe I'll find out some time.

The milk punch was also great--it was balanced and you could taste the brandy just enough. The amount of nutmeg was perfect. We had a great bartender who was friendly and helpful. 

Next time I'm in New Orleans, I'll be stopping here or at least at another Ruby Slipper location (depending on when and where I am in the city since the restaurants are closed on differing days). I really enjoyed my meal and experience.",2014-12-01 01:24:17

We expected to wait a while, but we were seated as soon as we arrived with a party of 3. We had a high top table in the back of the restaurant close to the restroom, but it honestly was far enough away to not be a problem.

We ordered the trifecta, the chicken benedict, and the chicken sandwich.   Everything had such great flavor -- the trifecta had a selection of chicken, pork, and shrimp on the benedicts, the chicken sandwich had a cajun slaw included. The chicken sandwich was tasty, but the piece of chicken was quite large it made it difficult at times to bite because the tomato kept slipping from between the bread. The chicken benedict order needed a bit more hollandaise sauce, but the fact they served it on biscuits was wonderful. 

The waitress was really sweet, but she was extremely busy so she did not check in on us too often. My friend wanted to get an extra order of hollandaise sauce, but it was impossible because the waitress never came back. The place was always crowded when we passed so it's not surprising that this was the case, but we did notice other waiters were more available to their tables.

I decided on the breakfast sandwich - scrambled eggs, sweet bacon, a slice of fried green tomato, with a biscuit.  The server said it was an open faced sandwich.  My plate comes and it was a typical plate.  Everything was like sides.  Why call it a sandwich?   The fried green tomato was tasteless.  Seemed it was frozen, then fried to reheat.   Unedible.  The best thing about my breakfast was the biscuit. Hubby's French toast didn't resemble French toast that we're accustomed to.  It looked like long wide banana peels.  Limp.

It was not busy, but yet a 15 minute wait. A couple came after us and said they'd sit at the bar so they could get seated sooner. I look and they're sitting at a table. That was strike number 1. We finally get seated and our server waits 5 minutes before even acknowledging us, but walks away saying he'd be right back. Another 5 minutes pass, he says I haven't forgotten you and again walks away again. No water, no drink order, nothing. By this time I'm frustrated. He finally comes to our table and tries to apologize but it was too late. The sad part is that he was attending to a table right beside us. All he had to do was take our order. We got up, told the host who said he'd get the manager, who never came. The WORST service I've experienced in a very long time.

I had a group of 6 eating breakfast here Saturday morning.  We arrived at 9:30 and only had about a 30 min wait.....I was expecting worse.  However, when the hostess came to see us she freaked out that there were only 5 of us present (my boyfriend had gone to add more change to the meter).  She even started asking random people if they were our 6th.....ummm, chill girlfriend.  She was obviously quite flustered and wasn't dealing with the hustle and bustle very well.

I saw that the menu only mentioned the double sized alcoholic beverages, so when our waiter arrived I asked if I could have a regular size (as I have always done at another location).  He was very unappologetic when he informed me that they had recently revised the menu and only offer the double size.  REALLY?  Um, not everyone wants to get schwasted in the am.  First, I think this was a dumb move by management, and I wasn't impressed by my waiter's response.

Other than some mildly rude service, the rest of our experience was great.  Our food arrived pretty quickly considering how busy the place was.  I ordered the Eggs Blackstone (poached eggs, bacon, tomatoe, biscuit, hollandaise) and it was delicious.  My egg was a little over cooked, but it was still very tasty.  Other folks at the table ordered the Smoked Salmon Bennie and commented on how good it was.  Although the salmon wasn't really smoked salmon....looked like it had been baked....but again, still tasty.  2 other friends got the Costa Rican Breakfast and raved.  The shrimp and grits were delish too.  Overall a solid experience.....but I think the staff needs to brush up on their manners a bit.

Update: Revised to 2 stars.  I've eaten here again and another dissapointing experience.  I ordered the migas which I've had several times at another location.  They were not good here.  And just this morning, my boyfriend tried to take his parents from out of town here because they were staying near by and it's closed.  Nothing on the website....just closed for maintenance.

We did that and still ended up waiting an extra 20 minutes, but it was well worth the wait!",2018-08-25 21:07:10

We prefer more breakfast type options for brunch than turtle soup or anything we would have ordered at one the traditional places in NOLA. Don't let the long lines scare you off the food is absolutely worth the wait. We had 2 specials of the day. My wife an avid pancake lover order the cinnamon roll pancakes and said they were in her top 5. I had the chicken St. Charles which had poached eggs served over fried chicken sitting on fried grit cakes. The grits were amazing and the sauce and chicken combined with the yolk to make a perfect bite. Go check them out and enjoy the weather while you wait and be ready for a delicious breakfast,2014-01-19 18:48:49

After reading the reviews, we ordered mostly the highest recommended dishes. It was just my husband and I but we ordered 3 entrees. The French Toast (bananas, raisins and rum), the Chicken St. Charles and my husband ordered the Migas.

The Chicken St Charles is a fried chicken breast on a soft, yummy biscuit with a dollop of spicy sauce. The French Toast is amazing. The perfect amt of bananas on top of french bread french toast with a rum maple syrup dressing and raisins. Just ridiculous. My husbands Migas was equally delectable but with totally different flavors. A little spicy but not too much. 

Next time I'll get a double mimosa with my order. I don't think they do any dish wrong here.",2015-09-11 16:17:29

It rated pretty high by the locals that I talked to. I can certainly see why. This place is packed.  There were many groups of people outside waiting to be seated. so for the sake of time... we climbed up on some bar stools and placed our orders. At the time this was the only place to sit. So with the aid of a step ladder(ha) My cute short wife was able to get situated. I felt fortunate that we got a place at all to sit.

This place is a bit boisterous (some people just don't need sleep) for such an early timeframe. When you take into consideration where you are, this makes perfect sense. The party is where you find it....or make it.

There are many items to choose from. I had the eggs Benedict w Hollandaise sauce resting on top of potatoes and corned beef hash. This filled the plate up. I was stuffed. This was very tasty. You know...food in NOLA is so good! I did, however, find just a little more room for something else. I decided to get a Blood Mary, observing that it seemed to be a popular drink here. The Bloody Mary turned out to be a good choice. Not only is it full of vitamins and minerals that the body needs for good health. There was definitely some C2H5OH present in this concoction (the reason for the drink).  It came garnished with olives, lime, and two hot peppers which provided for a nice controlled burn on the way down.

I would definitely come here for lunch, however, during this trip I planned to visit each restaurant/bar only once.

In this town you just move from one party to the next. We were here with locals....need I say more.

This place may be newer, nicer and bigger than the other location in Mid-City, but I will never go back! The menu is similar to the Mid-city location, with some variations. They only have one kind of pancake! Give me a break! The location in Mid-City have quite a few different choices and they only have original buttermilk. And on top of that they were not even good! 

My main complaint is the service. It was busy, but I have been to plenty of other places with more of a crowd and better service. After ordering drinks we didn't get them for 15 minutes and then the waiter didn't come back for another 20 minutes to get our order. And we had to grab him as he was walking by. After taking our order, we did not see our food for another hour! And hour to make breakfast. Breakfast is the easiest thing to make and it took an hour. The worst part is that the waiter kept ignoring us, because I think he saw that we were pissed. 

When the food finally came out, my girlfriends was completely wrong! Bread instead of a biscuit, egg whites instead of regular eggs, and swiss cheese instead of american! Totally wrong, but after waiting almost two hours, she ate it anyways.

The Eggs Cochon (Poached Egg and Debris on a Biscuit) was simple but full flavored and filling. A bit of bacon or a side of hash browns would have rounded it out nicely.

The French Toast Bananas Foster was scrumptiouis. The crust was caramelized and crispy and the sauce was just sweet enough. No syrup required. This was a unique take on French Toast I'd love to recreate.

The Mimosas were nicely done. Nothing crazy but a nice way to make breakfast feel a little extravagant without much fuss.

The service was great. Very friendly and approachable. 

Ruby is a bit of a Dive, but its clean. Eclectic may be a better way to describe it. Its casual. Comfortable and social all at the same time.

Firstly this really is a must stop on the culinary tour - my first visit still has memories of those shrimp and grits that I had for breakfast - they were stellar.
Had the Louisianan omelet this time and it was good - stuffed with a generous portion of shrimp and cheese. The grits were flavorless and that was disappointing.  I ordered a side of fried green tomatoes because I will seize any opportunity to enjoy this when available.  I also ordered the candied bacon as an addition.  FGT- the tomato itself was perfect but it was heavily breaded, and not fried to crisp and I believe these may have been frozen because they were not hot and cool in center. Bacon was delicious but 2 very skinny slices so I would just say not as generous as I would have liked.  Biscuit was huge and perfect.
Side note- a couple of locals (meaning a young couple - she from east bank and he from west bank) were seated next to me about 5 minutes after I was seated.  ( at bar) they were very friendly and were the folks that make you want to come back.  The kid - he was 27 - helped himself to my cheese from the omelet, friend green tomato and was just as generous with his food to me.  Without my knowing they paid for my breakfast.

I downloaded the NoWait app, which did not work out so well.  App was saying, ""No line.  Come on in.""  It was more like a 30 minute wait.  This place usually has a healthy line, so I was pumped to learn about the Nowait app.  Maybe it's still getting the kinks worked out.  After we put our name on the list, it was cool to see how many people were ahead of us.  

To me, the food was a bust.  It's ok, but there are so many better options for brunch.  This was my first time, but I have driven by tons of times.  There is always a line.  I just assumed they had something going on.  They don't.  It's felt like trumped up diner food with a Southern angle.  

Our waiter was a squirrel.  Nice enough, but we were ultimately treated like tourists.  This is the dilemma for New Orleans dining.  If you go to a touristy spot, expect to get treated like a tourist.  We were rushed.  Our waiter Chris literally tried to take Shari V's plate while her fork was in her mouth.  Shari V don't play that, and promptly let him know.

In short, we won't repeat.  The place is kind of fun, but it is so easy to find better food and better service in this city.",2017-05-28 20:36:53

I went with my friend at around 9:30 and waited 30 minutes so to kill the time we strolled down Canal St to get to the sight of the Mississippi River. 

FOOD: I ordered the Eggs Cochon. A must have at the Ruby Slipper. The egg was perfectly poached, none of that harder center crap, just beautiful yolk all over my plate. And then let's talk about that biscuit. That stuff must be homemade because I haven't had a good biscuit like that (or is it California versus Louisiana?). The pork, biscuit, egg, all smothered in the yolk brings a sense of heaven to mind. The pork is moist and covered with yolk, the softness of the biscuit, and then egg and hollandaise-- each bite is just delicious. I highly recommend this dish and wish I could get this brunch in California! 

SERVICE: I wish I caught our waiter's name, I don't recall, but he was great. Not only did he was attractive and charming, he always topped off my friend's coffee and got me hot water. It was great service, or is it merely southern hospitality?

We each ordered an alcoholic beverage for breakfast. I ordered banana walnut pancakes and my husband ordered an omelet. My pancakes were good but nothing to write home about. They were less fluffy and more oily so the consistency was not as thick as what I'm used to. The bananas, walnuts and syrup made the pancakes better and they were pretty good. However my order came with two strips of bacon on top. I was fine with it, but that may cause an issue for a vegetarian. That should be disclosed on the menu.

My husband enjoyed his omelet. When it came time to pay the bill we definitely waited a significant amount of time for our bill, which wasn't fun since we were trying to get to the WWII museum at a decent time.

A friend of a friend recommended Ruby Slipper for a solid place to grab a quick bite, and since it was within walking distance in a downpour, that was all I needed to give it a go! 

After my last experience in NOLA (French Quarter Urgent Care -- see review), I am obviously a tiny bit leery of whatever I ingest this time around -- but my fears were totally unnecessary for this first meal back; everything was amazing! Our waitress was spunky and attentive, but not overbearing; the house Bloody Mary had just the right hint of spice; and my biscuits and eggs were cooked perfectly (eggs over-medium)! The staff even came over to apologize for ""the wait,"" for our food, which was seriously 10 minutes, max -- and that was *after* one of our plates accidentally hit the floor on its way out of the kitchen!

We went on a weekend and waited about 20 minutes to get in, which we were fine with. From what we noticed, it's much busier on weekends.. So hit up a week day if you have the time! 

  We sat at the bar, which was perfect for the 3 of us. The atmosphere was so fun and the interior so vibrant with Dorothy's Ruby Slipper accents all over the place (from art on the wall to a tape dispenser on the bar!) After looking at the extensive menu we all decided on the blackstone. It was INCREDIBLE. Served on a soft biscuit, the eggs Benedict were cooked perfectly and the bacon was delicious. The home fries were out of this world and I would definitely suggest getting them over the fruit cup (nothing special there). 

  The special on the day we were there was the turtle pancake. It was a fluffy pancake with chocolate and carmel syrup and pecans. We got one to share between the three of us and although it was delicious, we were too full to finish it!

  The final highlight of the meal was the Bloody Mary! I am not typically into spicy things, but this was incredible! They have huge jugs of the mix up on the bar and add it to the vodka (filled to about 3/4 of a pint glass with ice!!!) when you order.

However, the wait was well worth it! Our waitress was very nice, polite and happy. Even though there were a LOT of people coming in and out, the place was kept very clean. 
I had the Shrimp Boogaloo Benedict: I particularly enjoyed the freshness the Coubion sauce (a fresh tomato sauce) brought to the dish. With the crispiness of the fried green tomato. Yum!

We arrived roughly around 10:30 AM on a Thursday and the place was packed! I read reviews beforehand stating that they don't accept reservations, but through yelp we can join the wait list. It confirms your place in line, tells  you a return time, and the # of parties ahead. The smaller the group the easier it is to be seated because they have bar seats that had a fairly quick turnover rate. We returned by the estimated time the wait list provided for us, but unfortunately still had a 30 minute wait. When your table is available, you receive a text.

I ordered the Trifecta which is the perfect dish for those wanting to sample all of Ruby's signature Egg Benedict dishes. It comes with a serving of Eggs Cochon (slow-cooked apple-braised pork), Chicken St. Charles (fried chicken breast), and Shrimp Boogaloo (shrimp sauteed with pork). My friends got the Peacemaker and Chicken St. Charles. We also got two sides of pulled pork and breakfast potatoes to share. This was the perfect amount (if not more) for the three of us. 

The crowd pleaser of this meal was definitely the slow-cooked pork. The pork was extremely tender, but lacked a bit in taste. The shrimp was good - had a bit of a spicy kick to it. The Chicken St. Charles was mediocre in my opinion. 

Overall, Ruby's Slipper was a solid staple to our NOLA adventure. Unless you're pressed on time, definitely stop by (after putting your name down on the wait-list).",2018-04-08 19:07:20

Two of us got a variety of eggs Benedict, and all the yolks were cooked solid. Flavor was lacking as well.

Also, the menu listed the coffee drinks at $3.00, and when the bill came our latte and cappuccino we're $4.00 each. I'm not going to cry over $2.00 but I think it's messed up to charge different prices than the menu lists. $45 later (before tip) for 4 overcooked eggs and 2 coffee drinks, definitely not worth it.",2017-03-20 17:26:47

The eggs were poached with pork ""debris"" (a local dish) over a really fresh open-faced biscuit.  I'm not a poached egg person AT ALL. But I figured I'd give it a try at the recommendation of the server. Very glad I did.  Flavorful, and a good portion, with eggs runny enough to go with pork. Delicious.

I opted for the shrimp 'n grits, which was buttery, comforting on a surprisingly chilly day. Came with a biscuit- I'm not a big biscuit person, so it was okay. I was pretty satisfied with my selection, but one of my dining companions was a little frustrated that they ran out of things that he wanted to order.

We walked by the day before and the lines were pretty crazy...so we were glad for the timing.

We opted for first available seating, so for our party of 2, we got seated at the bar.

had the bacon bloody mary, which came with green beans and olives...had a really strong kick, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was like a meal in an alcoholic drink, with the bacon and veggies....bacon BM's seem to be pretty popular in the area and I gotta say that this one was pretty good.  Asked for some extra olives, cuz I love me some olives with my drank, and they happily speared 4 for me.  :) PLUS on that.

Also had the signature eggs benny...you have different ones to choose from, and if you can't decide, you can go with the peacemaker and choose two...we got the cochon (pulled pork) and the traditional bacon and eggs benny.  Wifey had a really awesome blueberry sweet pancakes...I think that's what it was called, it might have been fruit-filled sweet pancakes and blueberry was the choice this time around...but our bartender recommended it...wifey and i LOVED it!  As well as the eggs benny...prob would've ventured out a little further on the 2nd choice, but it was pretty good still).  

Service - The place got pretty busy after we got seated and we didn't get the pressure from our server to move quickly like some other reviewers mentioned, there was enough turnover and we never felt rushed.  In fact, we had pleasant convo's with our neighbors to the right and left of us, as well as our bartender.  Maybe it's just my winning personality (joke joke, it's the wifey who has that) that prevented that from happening.  But overall, all the servers were quite friendly.

Definitely touristy, but I guess there's a reason why...if you're a tourist, you typically go to the places that everyone else goes to...but you can avoid the crowds by coming early enough I think.  I also think there's another one in the area, but we wanted to go to this one, esp because it was close to where we needed to go next.  I could see that sitting with a fairly large group might incur long wait times...but again, I think that can be worked around.

There was a short wait until we mentioned that we didn't mind sitting at the counter, then we were seated immediately. The counter was very busy so we understandably had to wait a few minutes to have our drink orders taken.

This place looks kitchy, lots of large posters on the walls along with some things that you'd expect to see in an 'old fashioned' diner. The food was average. I ordered a western omelet ""E-Z on the cheese"". When it arrived it seemed like it came with double. I picked most of it off. The eggs were mildly fluffy which I was actually perfectly fine with, but the ham was salty with a capital S.

I needed water and food, and quick. I had read a few write-ups on the Mid-City location but rarely go to that side of town so I was excited to check out the Magazine Street cafe. 
Very slow service and when we got our food we were both, ""meh"" about it. It's hard to screw up breakfast (although I did get the breakfast sandwich on a very small biscuit and ended up having to deconstruct it since it was piled so high). 
Since I'm always willing to give a place a second shot, we tried it again a few days ago. On a Monday around 12.15 p.m. we sat at our table for 15 minutes before we were even greeted. All 3 of us in our party have worked in the service industry at one time or another so we're pretty patient and understanding if a server is in the weeds. I even told my husband, ""If they're busy then I get it, just tell us you'll be right with us and get us a water or something!"" Nothing. The host wouldn't make eye contact and there wasn't a manager to be seen. We ended up going to the bar to get our drinks, which took a long time, too, because the bartender automatically made my friend's drink a double and then had to void it out with a manager. 
We waited about 50 minutes for food, no apologies for the slack service or time of our food. There was no check-back to see how our meals were until our plates were almost cleared.
Again, the food was just okay. Definitely not worth the wait.
The building is cute and it's convenient for people on the Uptown side of the Quarter or in the CBD. The waitstaff and host all seem like they have better things to do, though.

Come early or wait a long time.

My husband and our friend ordered the Eggs Cochon.  We noted that the eggs in the South are very soft, perhaps not to everyone's liking.  Also, the pulled pork was quite flavouress.  We were expecting a pulled pork special of the house would be WOW, but it was  just salt and peppery and that's all.

One cool thing is they are linked to an app called Nowait.  Get it and use it to avoid waiting for 45+minutes to get a table.  So here is the reason for my 3-star review:
1 Star to the Host Stand - If you don't like people don't work a host stand.  Would say this was the only experience with NOLA locals where we felt we were the inconvenient customer.
4 Star to our Server - He was awesome and explained what we should try which were all mostly good.
3 Star the food - This was our first breakfast stop in NOLA.  It was good, but we did have many better food experiences.
1 Star - The noise!  I have never been in a restaurant that was so noisy.  Try some sound dampening ceiling tiles or something.  Won't take from the charm of the rest of the atmosphere.

My croque madame looked really delicious and it was but I thought there was too much bread so I ended up not eating most of the bread. I also substituted the fries for a fruit medley. My favorite thing there was the biscuits that went under the benedict(s). They were very moist and soft but the exterior had a crunch which was very nice. I really enjoyed the eggs Cochon benny. The applewood smoked pulled pork was really flavorful and sweet. The chicken st Charles benny was very flavorful too. Chicken tenders were fried so it felt like chicken and biscuits.

I ordered  all 3 of their signature items.

Eggs Cochon (2/5) - Biscuit was surprisingly amazing, but the protein was lacking salt.

Chicken St. Charles (3.5/5) - Biscuit was amazing again. And again, the chicken could use more seasoning

BBQ Shrimp& Grits - (1.5/5) - Shrimp&grits is a sensitive topic only for me because i'm always looking for the best in New Orleans. Currently Surrey's hold the title and still does. Ruby Slippers version is just a little to watery for me. Although a friend of my preferred their grit texture to be more creamy than Surrey's version.

Bananas Foster - I won't give this a rating because all you have to do is make sure it's sweet and fattening. Nailed it.

I will say this. They use the same biscuit for every dish. Their biscuit is ABSOLUTELY amazing. It was the star on the plates that had biscuits.  

The service was standard given that it was busy. Be mindful that you have to have a full party in order to be sat.

I think it's worth mentioning that the waiter (whose name is Joe I believe?) was really nice about it. He offered to get me plain coffee with ice on the side when he told me they were out. 

The food was quite good...tho I think my meal would have been much better when combined with a savory dish like the migas.
I got kinda sick of how sweet the french toast thing was by the time I finished half of my meal. Granted though, I don't really have much of a sweet tooth (but I really wanted to try banana foster before I left New Orleans haha) so take my words with a grain of salt.

So my personal recommendation would be to get a savory dish along with the banana foster dish if you can~ 

You know what'd be awesome? If they made a combo platter where you could have a little bit of both dishes. :) But maybe that's just my brain getting ahead of me again.

When the Arnold Palmer arrived at the table it had two ice cubes in it as if had been left sitting at the bar for 30 minutes. We pointed it out to the waitress who politely said she would get the manager. The manager, Raffeal, came over to the table and said there was nothing wrong with our drink that's just the way they look. At that point we asked for the drink to be removed from the table and for him to get us another drink at which he refused and said our policy is not to remove drinks from a table. So he left the watered down drink at our table throughout the entire meal. When we were presented with the bill, that same drink now was on our check, even though the drink was never even touched. When we asked to speak to Raffeal again he became combative, disrespectful and threatened to have us removed from the restaurant because we complained about the drink. Had I not watched the table next to us complain about their food and this same manager swiftly remove their entrees and replace them with new ones then I would be more inclined to believe the policy. Another manager stepped in and removed the drink from the check but we never should have been treated the way we were by Raffeal.

Add a perfect poached egg and delicious lemony hollandaise and it was sheer perfection. My husband took one bite and said, ""I'm jealous"".

If you don't plan on texting people when their party is ready, just tell them to wait around and they will be called. Simple.

Assuming you live in an area with decently good brunch options, I see no reason to wait for Ruby Slipper... unless you desperately craved brunch in New Orleans for whatever reason.

Croque Madame: sad and poorly executed. The brioche bread was dipped in an egg batter which came out overcooked and dry. The fried egg was undercooked - the egg whites by the yolk were still translucent and raw. Seriously??

Migas: decent but forgettable.

Eggs Cochon: decent and tasty. The housemade buttermilk biscuit was nothing special.

French Toast: like the croque madame, the brioche bread came out overcooked and dry. The fruit compote topping was nothing special.

The other ordered a Louisianne omelette, which is a shrimp and thyme omelette. I think he ate the shrimp out of it when he started getting full. Can't blame him. It also included an excellent pancake, half of which I stole. 

I think I ordered best: they have several takes on the traditional Eggs Benedict, and I couldn't decide between the Benedict Cochon (a barbecue version) and the Blackstone (a bacon and grilled tomato version). Fortunately, you can order a ""Peace Maker,"" which allows you to have one of each. It turned out to be a good combo. 

The Eggs Blackstone has a terrifically crisp tomato, which may be the best use of a tomato I have ever experienced. I don't even like tomatoes much. Add in some perfectly cooked bacon and a poached egg, and it was a taste that made me feel smarter for ordering it. 

But, being in New Orleans, there was a decadent side that I just couldn't resist. That Eggs Cochon (French for pig) should probably give you a hangover if there were such a thing as food karma. It was wonderfully rich and flavorful and chewy and had just the right density. I had to force myself to quit eating it a couple times so I would have time to enjoy it. Now that I'm writing about it, I may have to go back tomorrow for more. 

Coffee was nice and strong, as coffee in New Orleans tends to be. There's no need for a Starbucks here - I don't think I've seen one, now that I think of it. The coffee all over town is better and less expensive than Starbucks anyway. Have a couple cups so you avoid the temptation to lapse into a food coma after your dining experience.

Minus two stars because our waitress at the table wasn't the nicest. Apparently you can't keep menus because they only allow food orders to be placed once. Not that I planned to order more than once but there was a side my dining partner was thinking about getting. It's not allowed so we didn't get anything extra after our orders were placed. Also giving away an extra chair at my table to someone who asked for it is ""frowned upon"" behavior. I've never heard such ridiculous restrictions put on patrons of a restaurant.

I had a chicken version and a shrimp with a fried green tomato.  All three were excellent.  The biscuit providing the base was exceptional  The toppings were also very good.  Nice amount of heat on the spicy version, well seasoned chicken filet and a very tasty sauce on all three.  
We also had a couple of breakfast drinks: A peach bellini/mimosa combo for the SO and a very well done bloody mary for me.

Cochon: Eggs perfectly poached, hollandaise well made but nothing to write home about, pork was tender and juicy. 4/5

My girlfriend ordered the omelette and she had issues with her meal also. Her omelette was undercooked and had to send it back also.  I remember the waitress noting that the kitchen has a tendency to do that. She had it replaced and enjoyed the rest of her meal. 

In defense of the restaurant, they were jammed with people that morning so I understood.

They are VERY pushy about the Thanx app which was slightly off putting  as we were told multiple times about it. We looked it up but you have to enter a credit card, no thanks.

The food is reasonably priced and we had an idea of what we wanted. The waitress brought our drinks and asked if we needed suggestions to which we said we had an idea of what we were going to order and she didn't seem to happy about that which was odd. However, I was torn between two entrees and asked her advice. My fiancé got the Southern Breakfast and I ended up going with the Bam Bam Biscuit. They were both good...I mean just good.

-No indoor waiting area.
-""Breakfast all day!"" means until 2pm, when they close.

Our party of five arrived around 11:30am on the Thursday of Mardi Gras weekend. (I know, I know.) We were told it would be a 25-minute wait, give or take. We weren't seated until 1pm, and no one give any updates before then of how much longer we'd be waiting. (Plus, we had a pregnant lady in our party, and we practically needed to cross the street in order to avoid smokers.)

All told, our meal was outstanding. I had the Bananas Foster Pain Perdu, and if I were on death row with a scheduled execution in the morning, I might want this as my last meal. I'm salivating thinking of it right now. Friends got the BBQ Shrimp & Grits and assorted omelets and each one of us was stuffed to the gills.

Now, my sister is an artist and was able to make it taste so much better - see the before and after pictures. This review was being written half way through the meal - now let me complete it when we got the bill.

We see the bill and we've been mischarged for our Irish cream coffee - when asked, the server told us that most people like it with whiskey so I got that one for you.

First the service sucked.  I felt very ignored most of the time.  I kept looking for people for this or that and the guy next to me got great service.  How do I know? Because they kept coming back to him to offer this or that. He was even served at the same time as me even though he came in AFTER me and he got his check before me.  FAIL.. I have my theories as to why but I wont say but yeah I guess i wasnt the right....

Anyway, worse than the awful service my food came out cold, like completely cold.  I cant even call it luke warm it was cold like maybe it had been sitting in a refrigerator and warmed up to room temperature.  I dont understand even how a breakfast can come out cold when breakfast food cooks so quick (especially what I ordered).  I ordered the southern breakfast. I mean it doesnt even make sense that it would be that cold from them waiting but I dont understand how the man next me and my order came out together even though he came after me, it still shouldnt have been THAT cold. The grits were were room temp. gross. the bacon was undercooked and floppy and cold!! just straight cold. The fried green tomato was mushy all around.  The more I type the more Im coming to realization, Im starting to think this was someones breakfast from earlier and they sent it back or changed their mind and the cafe left it sitting there and decided to serve it to my black self later. The biscuit was room temp and the worse this is what really did it for me the eggs were cold.  HOW ARE EGGS COLD??!!!! when they supposedly just came out of a skillet, clearly these were not.  Even the coffee wasnt hot it was just warm.   


I was so disappointed in this place.  After coming here on recommendation and it getting great reviews I did not have a good experience.  A shame too because I love breakfast but not this one. Im glad to see majority did not have my same experience.  As for me I wouldnt  return or Ill try to other location.

P.S. I didnt send it back as I never send food back at a restaurant no matter how cold or awful because Im terrified of them doing something to my food so I just deal",2014-06-12 15:18:32

Cons- food took a while coming to come. The group behind us found a roach on the wall crawling towards us then it fell so no telling where it ended. The mimosa was nasty. It could have been the OJ, but either way I did not like it at all.

Once inside, the staff was so energetic and friendly, which was really nice. We ordered as fast as we could so we could get the orders in before everyone else did. 

I ordered a double mimosa which tasted more like a half mimosa, and a croque Madame. The food took a fairly long time to come out, but that was understandable because 40 people had just walked in at the same time. Once the food came out, it wasn't fully cooked--parts were cold, and the whole thing just seemed slopped together.

My breakfast left me full and satisfied.  The biscuits were perfect without butter.  The eggs were fluffy.  The bacon was crisp.  And the fried green tomato hit the spot.  Everything that everyone at our table ordered looked amazing.  It also was pretty easy on the wallet, which is always appreciated.

For starters, our waitress was amazing. Sadly, I don't remember her name. But, she had an awesome personality, almost theatrical. She kept our big group of 7 entertained the entire time. 

On to the food---- Truly derrrrrricious! 
I had the Cost Rican: Rice, beans, salsa, eggs and plantains. Blasting with flavor! the eggs were cooked perfectly. I added chorizo to mine and it totally hit the right spots. 
I also tried the CB Benedict and that was amazing as well. I'll probably order that next time. 

If you're craving something sweet I would recommend the the Smores French Toast. So good! and such a unique spin on a classic favorite. 

Don't forget to order the bloody mary! They garnish theirs with fresh pickled green beans. Freakin' awesome!

The Ruby Slipper has some darn good breakfast. I'm from NOLA and had never been here before. Recently we came for a vacation and had breakfast here 3 times over the few days we spent in NOLA. It was that good I promise! The line can get long so try to get there early. The earlier the better. This is one of the best breakfast spots in NOLA so expect lines if you don't come early. They do a great job of getting the food out so you should be seated in 40 mins or so regardless. So just walk around and they will give you a call/text.

Ok so what to try:
-The first day I tried one of their signature benedicts. Absolutely delicious. You can either just get one or try multiple benedicts. I tried the salmon, corned hash and the chicken St.. Charles. 
-The buttermilk pancakes are really amazing as well. I tried the banana pecan and my god it was good.

The buttermilk biscuit - you will need therapy for the ecstasy you experience. 

The Louisianan - this shrimp omelette will make you want to smack the chef. Delicious!

The pancakes - beautifully golden browned and tasty. Only the devil would make something so tempting.

Tips: 
1) If you're a late-riser, take advantage of Yelp's service by putting your name on the list to be seated when you're getting ready to go to the restaurant.  That way when you get there, you might only wait 3 - 5 min to get a table!
2) The RS makes their own biscuits, & they're incredible.  Huge & fluffy.  IMO, the buttermilk biscuits are reason enough to visit this restaurant.  
3) If you love Eggs Benedict (and who doesn't?), Ruby Slipper is the place to get it.  Perfect poached eggs are challenging for any kitchen, as is a good Hollandaise sauce, so it's always a pleasant surprise to find a place that gets them right.  The Ruby Slipper takes it a step further, though.  Instead of using English muffins for the base, they use those heavenly biscuits I mentioned.  Next, they offer 6 deliciously creative takes on the classic EB.  Here's the best part: can't decide on just one? No problem.  They have a 7th option called The Peacemaker; pick two, & they'll put one of each on the plate.  How's that for service?  I had the Eggs Cochon EB & the Chicken St. Charles EB, & both were absolutely incredible.  The fried chicken was crisp on the outside, juicy on the inside...details, details, details.  The apple-braised pork debris on the Eggs Cochon was to die for.  I regret not ordering a pound of it to take home.  FYI: ""Debris"" a term used in Creole & Cajun cooking to refer to a braised meat. Best known for use in a hot po-boy sandwich, RS has used it here in an EB, and it's out-of-sight.

My dining companions ordered a florentine omelette (gigantic), a biscuit, and the Bananas Foster French Toast respectively - all were hits.

Great service, great food....Unfortunately one day I had a horrible service experience at this CBD location. I know (or thought I knew) how the seating worked. There was no line of people waiting outside to be seated. When I came in the hostess had just left from her station to seat a family of 5. I saw several empty seats at the bar so I went ahead and seated myself. I sat there for almost 3 minutes with no acknowledgement from either of the two workers behind the bar. There was a guy that seemed pretty busy but there was a woman who appeared to be free. I managed to make eye contact with her, she came over, I asked her for a menu she told me I would have to be seated by the hostess...I would have to get up from a row of empty seats, walk back to the welcome booth and ask to be seated?!?

I did so....The hostess apologized and stated I could have stayed put as there was no one waiting to be seated. While waiting to be acknowledged (again) another patron came in and made the same ""mistake"" as me by just sitting at the bar. The rude server also instructed them to see the hostess to be seated, their response ""I have to ask to be seated at the bar???"". After the person got up, she rolled her eyes and began complaining to seated customers about how she has to ""answer that kind of question all day"" and how ""people think they can just sit wherever they want"". I was looking dead in her eyes in disgust. How dare you complain about customers!!! There was NO LINE. I'd understand if it was a busy time of the day. The rudeness was just uncalled for. I placed my order with the order server at the bar (luckily) and had pretty good service from him throughout my short meal.

In summary, get here early or expect quite a wait.  We went for 11am Sunday brunch (I'd rather wait than get up early, whatever) and waited a little less than the 35 minutes they told us.  Pleasant that they give you a wait time, so you can decide if it's worth it.  My biggest complaint is that they don't advertise that you can get a drink at their bar (not seated, just order it) to have while you wait.  I would have loved to ease the wait with a bloody mary (hell, it's NOLA, okay!), and it would be more profitable to them, anyway.  I only realized they allowed this when I saw several people get seated with drinks in hand (and they both state and enforce you can't enter with outside beverages).  Their rules are posted, and are legit: no outside drinks, no reservations, and have your whole party ready.  We watched a number of ignorant patrons try to break all three, but they do it to keep things moving, and really, they're quite efficient.

Food is great, as everyone says.  Bananas foster was invented in New Orleans, so if you're a tourist you have to get that.  It's amazing, and the bacon is a nice salty compliment to the sweet dish.  They make a good bloody mary, not really hot but very peppery and spicy.  Also, their founding story about coming back after Katrina and doing their part to rebuild the city is nice; a feel-good yummy NOLA Sunday brunch.",2013-07-29 20:26:43

We all had double mimosas - i watched them make it and there was a LOT of champagne in those - good call. The menu was OK, nothing crazy stood out to me and when our meals came out no one raved about anything. Two of my friends had plates come out cold - when they requested to speak to the manager and told them it was cold, he looked at them like they had 3 heads. He just took the plates away. We were so shocked he didn't apologize or offer anything else. He came back later with the plate which looked soggy and we're sure he just heated it up - he again said nothing dropped the plates and then left. I saw him go in the back and roll his eyes - maybe if the food wasn't cold no one would complain, just a thought. 

I went to the bathroom and overheard a woman talking about how this place is a scam - she worked at the hotel next door and apologized when i told her about our experience. She recommended other brunch spots that she assured us we would have a better time at.

The first time visiting, we went to the one on Canal Street and it was delicious, we had four people in our party and we all ordered the same two entrees. Two of us got the weekend special: creole Benedict that had chicken, shrimp, and andouille sausage piled on a house-made biscuit, and the other two of us had the Saint Charles Benedict that was fried chicken on their house-made biscuit with a porky hollandaise.
These entrees were both delicious and perfect for a hearty breakfast for tourists that were walking all day long. We decided that we would return the next day for again a hearty-breakfast before heading to the airport to go back to Phoenix. When we visited their website to see what time they opened, we discovered they had a closer location on Magazine street and decided to go there. We arrived about 8:30 and they sat us right away. As we started looking over the menu, our waitress Neoka came and asked our drink order. My mom proceeeed to tell her that it was my 21st birthday and I need a drink. I ordered the Bloody Mary as it was a rewarded drink of theirs. It was very flavorful and we ordered the same entrees besides one. My mom also got the gulf fish St. Peter and it was delicious on  the corn cake which was like a polenta cake. Finally, Neoka had the kitchen staff make me a chocolate chip pancake with the number 21 written in melted chocolate on the pancake.

Started with the FRIED GREEN TOMATOES and had to say they were interesting. They had a wonderful crisp to them...tasted like the breading had fresh thyme in it which overpowers all other flavors. But I liked it. 

Daily special that day was the SOUTHERN PEACH PANCAKES. I have to tell you their pancakes really have that homemade taste to them so that was great. However the peaches don't really add much to the pancakes. 

My nieces ordered the BANANAS FOSTER PAIN PERDU which was heavenly but then again I'm a sucker for anything covered in freshly sliced bananas and caramel sauce. Definitely want to order this again.",2012-08-25 01:03:41

To nobody's surprise...of course it was fantastic! There is a reason this place has an incredible amount of good or great reviews. The food here was just brilliant.

This place quite popular and gets busy early, and stays busy...so come as early as possible in order to avoid the long wait. I was impressed by the techno savvy hosts & hostess that were running the place. They take your number and text you when your table is ready in addition to calling your name out loud. My friend and I got lucky, I think we waited for less than 15 minutes, while we were told it was going to be about 45 minutes. Maybe, because we were OK with sitting at the bar.  

So guess what...we sat at the bar and had the pleasure of being entertained by one of the bartenders; Jacob, real personable, genuine and helpful guy...apparently into fishing as well. 

To start I got a Bloody Mary Bacon. Excellent choice! One of the best Bloody Mary's I had! The  Bloody Mary mix is made in house, perfectly balanced...salty, spicy, tangy...pretty much how an excellent Bloody Mary should taste, topped with a piece of Bacon! BACON!!! 

I got the Gulf Fish 'St. Peter' - The fish of the day was a Big Red Drum also called  Channel Bass, Redfish, Spottail Bass, or simply Red (Information was from Jacob...free of charge). Its a local Atlantic fish, which happened to be exactly what I was looking for...something local. The Pan Seared Fish was excellent, light flakey perfectly complimented by the mustard sauce. I only wish the piece of fish was a bit more generous. Never had a Cheesy Grit cake before, this was something foreign to me...tasted like a lighter hash-brown, the inside was softer.

My buddy got the BBQ Shrimp & Grits. I got to sneak a taste of his dish. This was simply amazing...pretty much perfection! This is exactly how I pictured Shrimp & Grits in my head. Fresh local plump and juicy sautéed gulf shrimp with creamy flavorful grits! Yaassss! Even the buttermilk biscuit was delicious, light fluffy and full of flavor...bravo!

For a party of two, it was estimated it would be a 30 minute wait, but it ended up being only 15 minutes (yay!).  

No question, I got the Eggs Cochon (a twist on eggs benedict with pork debris on buttermilk biscuits topped with poached eggs and hollandaise).  With some splashes of hot sauce, perfect.  My husband got the bacon and egg breakfast sliders -- he is still talking about them.  One had ""pig-candy bacon"" and cheddar on top.  The other hand a fried egg and roasted red pepper.

I got the fried chicken and the Rueben, while my date got the salmon and shrimp. All were great, with the fried chicken being the favorite between us.  The biscuits are the bomb, and I regret not ordering a few to walk around and eat.  Maybe later.

Then as we're waiting (after having already ordered), I asked her for the wifi code - she replied that they did not give it out to the public?? 

This irked me, because I'm not the public, I'm a paying customer and every single other place I went to willingly gave the wifi code if you had ordered/paying customer. I know it may seem petty but it struck me as poor customer service at best.

We let our server know that we were in a time crunch as we were trying to catch a flight, so she got our orders out relatively quickly and we were able to pay for our tab right then and there.

They were very reasonably price ($6 I believe) and well worth it!

This place was recommended so we gave it a try. We could see the line from our hotel room, but still went down to put our name in anyway. They said the wait would be 45 minutes...nothing a few mimosas couldn't solve in the meantime. 

You can order drinks from the bar and stand outside while you wait on your table to get ready. Perfect time to make new friends in a great city. We actually took this opportunity to exploit New Orleans relaxed liquor laws and strolled the quarter with our drinks before our table was ready. We came back to only a 5-minute wait. 

The mimosas were great. They came in about a 16oz cup and 95% of it was champagne. No skimping here. Well worth the money. The food was delicious as well and didn't take long at all to come out considering the amount of people at the restaurant. We sampled so many items...banana pecan pancakes, andouille sausage omelet, strawberry and chocolate chip pancake, biscuit, and roasted potatoes. I'm no food critic, but all I have to say about it was that everything was delicious. 

A tip however is to have your whole party there when seated. We had two at the table and a friend came to join us but was not allowed to order as they don't allow late additions to keep the crowd moving. Definitely a must-stop if you are in the area.",2014-07-21 20:17:30

My wife used to work at the Mid-City location when we lived in New Orleans. I loved visiting the small neighborhood restaurant for an occasional breakfast that never disappointed..  When I found out that a CBD location was now open, I knew we had to pay a visit.  

First off, the location, decor, and atmosphere of this restaurant is perfect.  If you are a tourist or visitor to the city, this restaurant is likely within walking distance of your hotel.  Make that walk! 

I ended up ordering one of their classic dishes, the Bananas Foster Pain Perdu.  In layman's terms, this dish is French Toast covered in bananas slices and a sauce that usually consists of butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, dark rum, and banana liqueur.  Needless to say, it was wonderful!  The dish came with a side of bacon which was great to cut the sweetness of the dish.  I also ordered a side of grits and they were solid.

Two hours later I had been asking every fifteen minutes for an update and had been told any minute now. We didn't want to give up and go somewhere else just to start our wait over. Finally after over two hours waiting we were seated at a table that only fit most of us so two of our party had to stand near us waiting for seats to open up. We all ordered immediately and asked for anything he could bring to help those of us near fainting like maybe bring us a biscuit? Never happened. Most of our meals were completely flavorless and when I mentioned this I had to suggest to our waiter that he take it off the bill. I also suggested doing something else for us to make up for this awful experience but nothing else was taken off the bill. It's the first time in my life I paid only what I owed and left zero tip. Terrible experience. I don't know what others on here are tasting.

Update for Jennifer--I'm not sure there is a ""reply"" function...we were a party of 8 which was why I was surprised to be quoted under an hour. Still, if I had been told after that hour that they honestly didn't know when they could seat us I would have cut my losses. Our server knew what was going on and was very nice and apologetic. However we told him numerous times anyway that things were severely messed up and we were pretty bummed about it (two less chairs than needed, one person about to faint and had to leave to go home because she was getting light headed, mentioned specifically that bringing something fast like biscuits would be a good idea, didn't happen, mentioned a few times how bad the food was, only got mine comped after I directly suggested it, etc etc). I did not ask for a manager and I probably should have but our server was so sweet and kind to us I honestly thought he would do something more or that his hands were tied.

Order & Reviews:

*Blackstone Benedict - solid, not the best Benny. 
*Peacemaker- (order 2 Benedict's of your choice, good idea for a menu item) I got the...
        -Salmon Benedict  - No! Don't bother.

However, the Migos and the French toast and the other eggs Benedict more than make up for it. The waitresses are undiscovered stand up comedians, constant delight.

First off, you need to download the NoWait app that their website recommends. It saved us so much time. We got in line before we left the hotel so that we would get there just in time to sit. I checked in and we waited about 5 mins. A waitress was outside taking coffee orders so we grab a latte and a mocha. They were both very warm and tasty. We got to our table and our waiter Devin (Devon, Devan?) was the best. He was very helpful with navigating the menu when everything looks so yummy. The food was so good and it was served timely, hot, and correct. With it being so busy- it is easy to make excuses about why the quality will decline so when it came out perfect, we were impressed. I got the banana fosters French toast with the candied bacon. It was so great! The portion was huge. I had lots to share with the group which was so great because I don't share well. Haha The other items we got was the Trifecta, Peacemaker (Chicken St. Charles, Salmon Bennie), and another Peacemaker (Salmon Bennie, Eggs Blackstone). They all enjoyed their Benedicts! They said they would highly recommend those! Our waiter made sure we always had our drinks full and was a pleasure to be around. Highly recommend Ruby Slippers. It did not disappoint.

They place filled for awhile, tables cleared, more folks seated, etc, etc.  With plenty of open seats at the bar  they never reached capacity.  Of course this was early in the day but it shows the staff was on a roll.

We were all happy with breakfast.  Most of our party stuck with good ol' grits n' eggs type dishes. Shrimp n' Grits for myself.  The grits were almost unsalted which some folks may like but I kept hitting them with the shaker until the flavor brightened up a bit.  Other than that it was good but mine is better.

I ordered the shrimp & grits and was not pleased. It was about 6 pieces of tiny shrimp that didn't taste too great for $15. The ""grits"" tasted like a mix of cereal and salty oatmeal. To reiterate, the meal was very salty. As you can see from the photos, it just looks like a hot mess. I thought I was at a credible brunch spot, not a soup kitchen? It got to a point midway through where I just ate it because I was hungry, not that I actually enjoyed the meal. Maybe I should have gotten some mimosas to cloud my judgment on the awful food.

What's crazy is that we arrived about 30 minutes after they opened and we waited about 40 minutes for a party of two.

The only issue I had was some confusion regarding their system where they can send you a text when a table will open up. I opted into that but I never received a text and I think I heard her call my name a few times, but since I was waiting for a text I was across the street and had trouble hearing her. If you don't respond to your name after two tries, they move on quickly.
It was not a huge enough deal to effect my review, just be sure you're paying attention and don't rely on that text!

Anyway, once we were seated at the bar, the bartenders were quick to take our drink orders. I got a mimosa, and it's $10 for a double! I was pleasantly surprised as in Sacramento, CA, that is a common price for ONE. I ordered two of those and they were strong! 
For eats, I ordered the Corned Beef Bennie. The corned beef hash on it was amazing. No canned stuff here! This was made with thick slices of fresh corned beef and nicely sized chunks of deliciously seasoned potatoes and onions. The buttermilk biscuit it was served on was buttery and flaky and the hollandaise was creamy and divine. 
I enjoyed every bite and wished I could enjoy more! I only ate half because it was so filling.

The Migas, for those of you Midwesterners who don't know is a chorizo and vegie omelet served on a  bed of tortilla strips -- wow -- a little tobasco and you feel like you're in Mexico  -- great taste and not too heavy

The Pain Perdu - BF - is just unreal, caramelized sugar all over the large slices of french bread with bananas and pecans and raisins -- the bacon does a good job of leveling out the salty and sweet

Being from NYC, I would like to think I have developed a thick, oiled skin for rude hostesses and disgruntled servers. I must say, the hostess' pretentiousness is outstanding! Bravo! At least at Per Se the host/hostess graciously decline your rumbling, empty stomach with a smile, rather than a yelling, meth and/or tobacco stained RBF. Seriously girl, the hostess on the morning of Sept 14th needs some Crest whitening strips, STAT! Moving on, we were told there was over an hour wait on Sunday morning by the meth girl wielding an ipad. I was apprehensive to give it another try the following morning but the yelp reviews (and proximity to the hotel) swayed me. Upon arrival Monday morning, there was a 15 minute wait. Ok, great! We were asked to wait outside bc of fire hazards, yadda yadda. I had no problem with this however, I think the older couple wheeling their oxygen tank should have received preferential treatment. Making two octogenarians wait outside in 100% humidity (no joke, my iphone said so) is just WRONG! When our time was up, the hostess (the one that looks like the boss-lady on Workaholics, for real) called our name and began walking us past the podium asking ""Is the bar ok?"". In unison, we responded ""NO?!"" We just waited 15 minutes for a table!!! We could have sat at the bar upon initial arrival!!! WTH?
My bf and I had decided on what we were going to order while we waited to be seated. Being so efficient blew the waitresses mind. I ordered the house specialty, Eggs Cochon. I can't even remember what my man ordered, it was so blasé. My plate was literally covered in a layer of grease. The way the biscuits were plated made me think the server pulled the plate prematurely bc they had been huddled on one side of the plate, leaving the other side completely empty, aside from the grease layer. The meat was flavorless. It speaks volumes that they cook and serve flavorless pig! Yes, it was juicy and tender- really fabulous texture, BUT flavorless! This makes me very sad. The poached eggs were poached eggs. Frankly, if you cannot cook an egg properly, you should not own a breakfast/brunch restaurant, so I don't feel compelled to give exemplary marks for such a simple task. Onto the hollandaise... What a joke??! Hollandaise should NEVER be highlighter orange a la Kraft Singles! I don't care if your yolks are so friggin vitamin/lutiein rich, cage-free fresh! Anyone who has ever eaten a real/proper hollandaise would find what the Ruby Slipper serves to be disgusting and an insult to eggs, chickens and palates. Without a doubt, it started off as a pre-packaged powder that morning. The foundation of this food tower was a biscuit. It was good but heavy- not in the ""I just soaked up some pork juice"" heavy but more like ""the butter was not cold enough when baked"" heavy. I also ordered a double mimosa, which, I must say, was amazing! I must have gotten a bottle that was freshly popped bc the drink was crisp, refreshing and just what a girl needs before a three hour flight! The coffee was nice and hot but upon asking for a refill, we were met with a chilly response. If the décor wasn't so in your FACE about ""home"" and ""hospitality"" I probably would not have found the service to be so rough. The fact that the menu preaches about coming back home after Katrina to serve the community speaks volumes. The hospitality we received made it crystal clear they have ZERO interest in serving anyone but the locals.

Large warehouse with high ceilings.  T-shirts for sale.

Corned beef bennie and Irish coffee.  Any day is a good day when it begins with coffee.  With a supplement like that...hmm...it's a good day accelerated.

Don't even know where to start with the benedict.  Crisp home made corned beef on a buttermilk biscuit which is almost an inch thick.  Hmm!  Perfectly poached eggs, horseradish cream and hollandaise sauce.  Scrumptious.  I admit defeat and I couldn't finish my biscuit.  I will be back!!!

The waiter spilled a glass of water with  ice cubes next to me as he was clearing the counter.  Good thing I grabbed my phone and other stuff in time otherwise it would have been nicely soaked.  And who needs a wet lap!!

It's a nice little place, located right off Canal St serving some classic southern meals and then some. I've seen long lines of people waiting on weekends, but on a weekday Thu morning there was no line at 8am.  Sat at the large circular bar in the center

The food looked really good and from reviews and photos from other Yelp reviews, I was stuck between the Chicken St Charles and the Egg Cochon from the Eggs Benedict section on their menu.  I ultimately decided on the Egg Cochon, with the poached eggs lying on slow cooked pork and finished with their hollondaise sauce.  I did not regret it, and enjoyed the flavors as they melted together.  I even added some Southern Louisiana hot sauce and it was great.  You get 2 of them, so if you're not that hungry or want to try something else with someone, it's a good order to share.

The food was worth it, and I could see why there was a wait. Service was excellent and food was great. Will definitely come back to try other menu items.  Highly recommend.",2017-09-30 01:24:39

This restaurant has terrible food and even worse service.  The staff are cranky and seem annoyed at having to do their job.  

We arrived at 1 and our food was finally all on the table at 2:20.  Mine was 20 minutes after everyone else's.  

We sat down and were greeted promptly but it took a while to get our order.  After I ordered my food the waiter came back and said they could not make it without onions.

He came back 10 minutes later to tell me his other recommendation also had onions so I ordered something else.  A full 30 minutes later my food came out covered in onions .   After he took it back he returned another time and said that even that sauce had onions.  Strike 3.  Meanwhile the kids are starving and getting fussy because it apparently takes 45 minutes to make French toast and grilled cheese 

The server was highly frustrated and apologized while blaming the kitchen and noting he had noted onion allergy on his ticket.  That did not change the fact that we have been sitting waiting with little kids for over an hour.

Then finally the chicken eggs Benedict came out.  It was mase with TOUGH not tender chicken and boring sauce.  My wife said the fried green tomato was good but everything else was nothing special or yuck.

I feel like we got totally duped by all of the other good reviews.  The people sitting next to us also said their food was bad and they couldn't even get a cup of coffee because the machine was broken.  Hello?!  If your coffee machine is broken head over to a store and buy a coffee maker to use while yours is repaired!  Or go get a few gallons of starbucks.  I guess that would require a basic understanding of customer service which clearly is an ignored art at this awful restaurant.

After the waiters apology and explanation that he had noted allergy in the system and was sorry about the chaos, I thought for certain there would be a visit from a manager.  Nope.  Nothing.  I hope some of you fellow yelpers can avoid this awful tourist trap.",2018-02-06 20:41:34
TTOIGW0qSGWcFzZLckjCeQ,D1enSVmIcOo5JaIl3vb3Sg,oBNrLz4EDhiscSlbOl8uAw,5,0,0,0,"I visited the Ruby Slipper once in January 2014 for breakfast.  

I had the Spanish omelet, which consisted of three eggs, chorizo sausage, red onions, pepper jack cheese, and topped with a red pepper sauce.  The omelet was quite large, however the amount of filling was just adequate.  The chorizo was good, but it wasn't the super-intense style (which was OK, given that it was in an omelet). Overall my omelet was very good.  

The omelet came with a choice of grits or breakfast potatoes and toast or a biscuit.  Since I'm not from the south, I opted for the potatoes and (multi-grain) toast.  The toast was ordinary (but isn't most toast ordinary?).  The potatoes were large-ish chunks of small red potatoes.  They were likely partly cooked by boiling, then finished on the flattop.  They were moderately browned (but not crispy) and had a hint of rosemary flavor. Overall they were quite tasty taters. 

The coffee was better than average. A nice touch  -- my server gave me a full to-go cup of coffee when I left. 

I sat at the counter; service was prompt and courteous.  My coffee cup was kept full.  

Decor is pretty old school. The high-ceiling space has a nice feel.  Everything looked clean and in good repair.

I also had a pancake, which really stood out for me  because it was a bit more cooked than I'm used to, and definitely to its benefit.

The apple braised pork is omg...it melts in your mouth with every bite! I personally prefer my poached eggs to be more on the undercooked side so it'll ooze out. It was actually a bit more on the cooked side, which was a bummer. But overall this benedict was good! Thanks for the suggestion Yelp!

[ [ c o r n e d  b e e f  b e n n i e - $1 3 ] ]
Also a well done benedict! The poached eggs were more runny when we ordered this dish. So basically, they're not very consistent with their poached eggs. So it could be a hit or miss. The corned beef was cooked so nicely. Since it was a corned beef hash, the potatoes make this a more hefty bennie. And of course the hollandaise sauce to top it off makes the bennie just oh so delish!

Overall this good! I'm a fan :)",2016-04-07 00:16:14

AYopWKkw6QoYUNh5GJwe0w,2fMCkM8znXGhRRcPYtiE7A,oBNrLz4EDhiscSlbOl8uAw,3,0,0,0,"My wife and I were in New Orleans for the weekend and were pointed in this direction by a tour guide. Nice, loud ambiance and had the southern type of charm. Service was good. I ordered the cochon Benedict (it think that's what it was called, it had the pork debris) and Benedict with the fried chicken. Unfortunately mine barely had any of the sauces that were supposed to be ""smothered"" on top of it. The pork debris tasted great, but unfortunately the chicken was underwhelming. Both of the biscuits that they were on were good but not great. And the egg was poached very nicely to a medium.  My wife had the BLT but asked for a fried egg instead of the bacon because she does not eat pork. She felt the bread was too thick for what was inside of the sandwich. And looking at the bread, I felt the same way. But again, who orders a BLT with an egg and no bacon?? Haha. The iced coffee was nice and strong and tasted delicious, according to my wife. I don't drink enough coffee to really have a great opinion. But tasting it, it did taste delicious to me. Strong, sweet and a nice aromatic, crisp taste. I feel they prob just were running low on the sauce and was unable to smother mine. Or at least I hope that's the case. THe lack of sauce didn't give me the ""all warm inside"" feeling that southern food and Benedict's give you. It was unfortunate because I saw the guy next to me get the same things and his Benedict's were oozing with sauce =(. Service was really good and food came out in a timely manner. Yelp came clutch with letting us book a table so we didn't have to wait in the rain forever. This place has all the potential but didn't quite meet the hype it was given when we were served. If they have me enough sauce and the fried chicken wasn't thin and didn't taste slightly over cooked I would've Gave this place a 4 or four and a half star rating. Just constructive criticism. Sorry ruby slippers! I know y'all work hard to protect your reputation and I'm not trying to bash that. Just feel I got slighted on my food. Maybe it was my fault for not asking for more sauce.",2018-01-30 05:03:05

I got a cup of coffee which was really good. I also enjoyed the fried green tomato which is probably the best one I have ever had. The European omelet was perfect with melted brie cheese inside along with some portobello mushrooms. The potatoes on the side were seasoned very well. No need for ketchup.

You really work hard to screw up something as simple as breakfast foods, but the ""chefs"" at the Ruby Slipper did a great job at it. Eggs in the omelet for both me and the person with me were overcooked. Person next at the bar to me sent eggs back for being undercooked. Person across from me at the bar sent her breakfast back for something. Must have been a bad chef day. 

The ""creamy stone ground grits"" were hard and lumpy rubber. My 3 little pigs omelet with ""applewood smoked bacon"" tasted like regular bacon and for the $10 it cost - the Denny's grand slam would have been the better option.  As I read the other reviews I wonder was it just a really bad day for them, or do I expect a $10+ breakfast to actually taste good? The food was over priced for quality and portions. 

The decor is nice if you are into style rather substance. Bottom line is: go somewhere else. You are in New Orleans there other better options for breakfast at that price point.

The ""Corned Beef"" benny was the worse thing we had, it was a ""Corned Beef Hash"" benny and WAY too many potatoes - Very little Corned Beef.  Other than that our food was delicious.  I had the 3 different Benny's on 1 plate and we shared the Banana's Foster French Toast.  That was all amazing.

Although there were a lot of people waiting, they told us the wait was only about 15 minutes, which wasn't underestimated like many other restaurants. Once we were in, the staff was very kind and helpful. I got Migas, my friends got the Shrimp & Grits and the Chicken St. Charles. The Migas was tastefully spicy and quite flavorful. I would've licked the plate if I could. Shrimp & Grits were good, nothing noteworthy though. The Chicken St. Charles had deliciously crunchy and moist chicken, but the eggs benedict which was completely overcooked, the yolk was hardly runny. We also had a double mimosa and bloody mary.

Eventhough it was overhard, the dish was delicious as if it was made to be served like that.

Also, get the Bananas Foster Pain Perdu w/ candied bacon: add the candied bacon bc it has to be one of, if not, the best bacon I've ever had.  Only down side is the bread was difficult to cut into as my husband said it's almost like he needed a steak knife.

It's a Goldilocks and the Three Bears kind of place.

Too sweet:  The Bananas Foster Pain Perdu dish was good, but thank goodness it came with a side of bacon to tame just how super, super, SUPER sweet it was.

Too salty:  The Three Little Piggies omelet was good, though a tad on the salty side.

JUST RIGHT:  The Eggs Cochon dish is the house specialty, and it was greater than the sum of its parts. Individually, the poached egg, hollandaise sauce, pulled pork and southern biscuit are good.  Together, however,  the ingredients combine to provide the perfect bite and mouth feel.  It was love in my mouth.

The place is super loud, so you'll have to shout to be heard by your dining companions, and the service was inattentive because the place was just packed to the gills.

-1yXRBeeorcYucK7e6YQzw,f1br698nLP23Rxrswq_Eqg,oBNrLz4EDhiscSlbOl8uAw,5,1,0,0,"Thanks to a local for recommending The Ruby Slipper to my husband on his flight to NOLA. I had already been in town for 3 days and hadn't noticed the sweet little café right around the corner from our hotel (just off Canal).

First, let me say that all the food we had during our visit to New Orleans was superb. We had delicious fish, Cajun, pasta, steak (and that's saying a lot coming from an Iowan), and of course beignets. The two meals we had at Ruby Slipper were bar none the best of our entire visit.

Details:

The wait:

The line for a table appeared to be long each morning (we could see the front of the restaurant from our hotel room). We waited for the line to die down each morning, and visited around 11:30 on a Sunday and 10:30 on a Monday morning. We got right in on Sunday and waited about 10 minutes on Monday.

The service:

Good on our fist visit and fantastic on our second. Our fist server was attentive and our order was correct on our first visit. The server on our second visit was personable and proactive (my coffee cup was always full--my #1 priority). 

The food:

The real star of the show. Between our two visits, we tried the sliders, French toast, breakfast sandwich, and an eggs/grits/bacon breakfast. It was seemed to be ""normal"" food...we should be able to get an equivalent meal somewhere else, but it wasn't normal. It was delightful. The bacon, for example, was maple-y and cooked to perfection (again, we live in Iowa, home to Baconfest, so us raving about bacon is not to be taken lightly). The French toast was warm and melted in my mouth goodness, and everything else was just magical. 

Drinks:

The coffee was great diner-style coffee, and I also had a mimosa, which was strong and had what seemed to be fresh squeezed OF. 

The cost:

Affordable! Each plate was about $10, making our meals not only the best of our visit to NOLA but also the most budget-friendly.

Be sure to visit The Ruby Slipper next time you are in town.",2014-11-24 19:57:14

She was a rockstar.

On our second visit, during Sunday brunch, I got the Eggs Blackstone and a lovely double mimosa. The double bellini was well-received at my table as well. Our visit was very different on a busy Sunday because of our wait time, but the service and food was consistent.

When I return to NOLA, I will definitely be stopping here.",2015-07-12 04:00:03

Every now and again, you find a place that has a 5-Star Yelp review, and it's actually correct. This is one of those places. First, they have an online wait list that tells you the time they think you'll be seated, which was super handy, as the last thing I want to do is hang out in a restaurant foyer waiting for my table. So the app told us it was a 46 minute wait, and we waited a good half hour before heading over there. My goodness, there were 100 or 150 people in front, waiting for their table. This place must be something. 
It is.
Because it's New Orleans, you can get an alcoholic beverage right on the street in a to-go cup, so they had a person getting people cocktails. I had the Bloody Mary with bacon-infused vodka. Yes, bacon-infused vodka. It was as spectacular as you would imagine. 
We sat at the bar when we were called, exactly at the time quoted. I don't know what kind of magic that online wait list works on, but it's something special. The bartender was super friendly, and gave us huge mugs of coffee. My wife ordered the shrimp and grits, and I had the Migas. The shrimp and grits were simply to die for. There was tremendous seafood flavor in the grits, and the shrimp were enormous, yet tender. The dish comes with a biscuit and some kind of sugar/honey butter. Fabulous. If you're hung over, this is the dish to eat (we were). 
As for the Migas, I thought they were okay - not really a composed dish, rather it was a bunch of stuff I like that I had to kind of put together myself. I ordered wrong. I should have had one of their signature Benedicts, which my neighbor had. It looked like a work of art. Oh well, I guess I'll try one next time.",2017-10-17 19:38:00

Front desk ladies: AWFUL, RUDE, AND HAD THE WORST ATTITUDE.  Not HELPFUL OR WELCOMING AT ALL.

FOOD: I had tried at least ten other restaurants around the area and this was by far - not the best.  I ordered the croque madame. I had eaten one the day before at another restaurant so I decided try it here. There was so much meat, I lost the flavor of everything else that usually made it a pleasant combination. The ham was too sweet and it made the bread sooooooo soggy I sent it back. (The waitress had to ask for permission... Ridiculous..if a customer isn't happy you should respect their wish within reason).  I requested to order the combination Benedict, AFTER the manager approved of course.  That was a lot better, but nothing special about it.

Finally after over two hours waiting we were seated at a table that only fit most of us so two of our party had to stand near us waiting for seats to open up. We all ordered immediately and asked for anything he could bring to help those of us near fainting like maybe bring us a biscuit? Never happened. Most of our meals were completely flavorless and when I mentioned this I had to suggest to our waiter that he take it off the bill.

I really suggest using the yelp app to put your name on the waiting list so that you don't have to wait for 1+ hours. Also, be prepared because when I went they warned us it was taking 30-40 min to prep food orders and they were out some of their menu items.",2018-05-24 16:58:25

Our waitress brought us our bill in the middle of our meal which we felt was like a ""hurry up and get outta here"" move.

We came again because the boyfriend wanted the best omelette he's ever had. We came earlier, so there was no wait and less busy. The hostess remembered us. And we got the same waitress who remembered us too. Sadly, the omelette was not as great as the first time. Not as tasty and less meat. So his quest for the best continues. I got the CBH Benedict which was good. Though I've never had CBH in chunks instead of more mashy like.

Every time we walked by this cafe, we noticed a huge crowd, so one morning, when we did not feel like walking back up to the French Quarter for the umpteenth time, we decided to stop by Ruby Slipper.

We were there on a Saturday around 11 so the breakfast crowd was just starting to leave while the lunch crowd was beginning to trickle in. As soon as I opened the door to the cafe, I was greeted by a blast of noise from the multiple conversations going on all at once in a large echoic building. Since we were there for a nice romantic weekend together, my boyfriend and I did not feel up to sitting in such a crowd shouting at one another just to have a conversation, so we opted to order to go. Unfortunately, the cafe does not take to-go orders on weekends, so we decided to get a table and hope for the best. 

After about a fifteen-minute wait, we were of course seated between two large groups of young men who had arrived to cure their hangovers. Nevertheless, we felt that if we could not enjoy the atmosphere, we could at least enjoy the food. We took advantage of their breakfast-all-day menu. Since we were both big fans of the original egg benedict, I ordered the eggs cochon, and my boyfriend ordered the CBH Benedict. The eggs cochon basically consisted of pulled pork, with eggs benedict. Unfortunately, I was not a fan of the dryness of the pulled pork, especially since I was expecting braised pork, and the way it sopped up the egg yolk so that it became just one very salty, soggy mess. I was only able to stomach one of the two I was served. My boyfriend, however, did not mind downing his CBH Benedict and my remaining eggs cochon. His CBH Benedict consisted of beef hash and an egg benedict. The one bite I stole from his plate revealed a very moist and tender slice of beef that surprisingly complimented his egg benedict. But, like my eggs cochon, it seemed rather salty. 

While the Ruby Slipper was conveniently close to our hotel, had quick service, and had an impressive menu, I was disappointed by the fact that we spent the entire dry, salty meal in silence. On our next trip to NOLA, we'll have to pass on revisiting this cafe.",2013-09-18 13:08:25

I finally got the opportunity to visit the teacher lounge after school one day, and was sadly disappointed that the lounge was nothing more than a sticky table with four chairs, and an old beat-up refrigerator. That's exactly how I felt when my husband and I visited the Ruby Slipper. Whenever we visit New Orleans there is always a long line waiting to get into this place. We were intrigued and wanted to see what all the fuss was about. The service was terrific, but the food was disappointing. I refuse to believe that people would wait in line to eat mediocre food, so maybe it was just what we ordered. My husband had the strawberry cheesecake French toast, and I had the shrimp and grits.

Me and my buddy was just recuperating from a very good evening on the town and I mentioned this place and he was like, lets do it! It wasn't far from the hotel so it was an easy 10 minute walk. Walked in and grabbed a booth and took a gander a the menu. Our server Demetra who was very awesome gave us the low down on the good menu items as there were so many to choose from. She started us out with some Big Easy mimosas which were bigger than normal mimosas...more like 4 mimosas in one glass. I started out with the Ruby Slipper mimosa which is OJ + pomegranate...pretty good! Then I did the blood orange mimosa which was much better. 

Now onto the food!!!!
I knew I probably was gonna go with the BBQ shrimp & grits, but Demetra did a great job of not letting me sway away from that idea. I was a little weary as some places don't do shrimp & grits well, but dammit this is Nawlins!!! Very good dish and a nice size! The shrimp were sautéed along with an amber beer and rosemary reduction. The dish came along with a big ass biscuit. My homie got the Gulf Fish St Peter which came with Drumfish in which neither of us ever had...it was pretty damn good and one of the best pieces of fish I've ever had. The dish came with a pretty good cheesy grit cake and a grilled shrimp skewer. 

I love this place and would definitely return again when in New Orleans",2017-11-17 13:40:38

While the decor is whimsical and unique, the food is just average.

The portions were large. The biscuits fell a little of shy of being flaky goodness, the cinnamon pancakes were average and nothing unique that you would remember after you left the establishment, and the baton sticks were on the greasier side. 
Given the popularity of the restaurant, as seen by the number of customers patronizing the establishment, and the fact that there are three locations within a short area, my opinion definitely seems to be of the minority of customers rather than a majority of customers...so proceed forth with caution and decide for yourself if you are in the majority or in the minority.",2018-10-29 08:46:56

With a wait like that, I expected to be wowed. So many people recommended this place to me. There is so much GREAT food in New Orleans, I was shocked at how disappointing this meal was.

Ordered the eggs cochon...the pork was GREAT! Wonderful flavor, could totally stand on its own. But the biscuit...meh. And the mere dollop of hollandaise...disappointing. Even the poached eggs were a let down- over cooked and gummy. 

Also got the French toast. I love French toast. This is the first place I think I've ever been to that couldn't even nail that. It was overcooked and after asking for and not getting any syrup, I had to get some from another customer. 

Ordered an Irish coffee to go... And it was cold. Cmon, really?!? They did remake it for me, but I shouldn't have had to ask. This was the only blight in an otherwise epic food journey through New Orleans.",2016-01-03 17:36:08

As for the food, portions were generous, but I have to echo a minor complaint that I saw in another review.  I ordered the Eggs Cochon -- like an Eggs Benedict but with a biscuit instead of an English muffin, and pork debris instead of Canadian bacon -- theirs were the most well done poached eggs I'd ever had. The yolk was completely solid without a hint of runniness to them. I also had the breakfast potatoes, which had good texture, but were a tad bland.  The other folks in my party were happy with their orders, though, and over all, it was a good dining experience.

I came here for brunch and had a pretty difficult time deciding what to get since everything on the menu looked amazing. I ended up choosing the Chicken St. Charles- fried chicken served on buttermilk biscuits, topped with two poached eggs and a pork tasso cream sauce. This dish was so incredibly tasty. The chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The buttermilk biscuits were flaky and buttery with a slight crunch. The sauce tied the dish together- it was creamy and super savory. I'd highly recommend this dish. In addition, I had some breakfast potatoes and they were pretty good, but they were a bit under seasoned in my opinion.

First of all, your hostesses are completely personality-free/bordering on bitchy. In fact they are some of the most non-personable, unpleasant, unwelcoming hostesses I've ever experienced in New Orleans! (Last year when my sisters were visiting from Atlanta, one of the hostesses was so unfriendly they vowed never to return--right before hitching a taxi across town to Atchafalaya;) Perhaps these girls should be reminded that this is not Lilette, Le Petit Grocery, or Revolution so there's no need for the snobbery. Secondly, there's a ""bipolar"" bartender that's sometimes very nice and sometimes considerably bitchy. (Though the other bartender MJ is the cat's meow.) Thirdly, on two occasions my eggs have been brought out completely cold, and the last time I visited I had to wait over 30 minutes for the Southern Breakfast (eggs, grits, a biscuit, and a flavorless fried tomato) when people sitting around me who'd arrived way after I ordered seemed to have only waited 10-15 minutes for their more elaborate meals...

Now clearly this place is not suffering from a lack of patrons, with endless winding lines around the corner almost every weekend (though my guess is that it's gotten lots of possibly outdated press and has become a trap for tourists who don't know any better), so maybe there's not much of a motivation or desire to improve/modify anything going on there. But if you guys don't get it together and start treating us locals with a bit more care and respect, you're gonna eventually start leaving us with a ""bad taste"" that even warm, promptly-delivered eggs won't be able to get rid of.",2015-03-17 09:22:08

Tables are high and low of solid wood. Service is friendly and quick. Tables are turned quickly and the wait averages 60 to 90 minutes. Full round bar service available serving mimosas, Bloody Mary, or tequila shots, to name a few. Yes this is breakfast in NOLA. 

The food is generous and the breakfast potatoes are chunky. The Peacemaker Benedict offer a combo of two different Benedict of your choice from the menu. I got one of the Chicken St. Charles and the Blackstone. The chicken was lightly battered and crispy. Very juicy too. The Blackstone was excellent as well. Hubby had the salmon and the other was corn beef. Portion was plentiful and flavorful. Overall, excellent experience!

+ Ambience was nice and open.

Eggs benedict and variations of are my kryptonite so I opted for the Eggs Blackstone with a side of breakfast potatoes.

Overall the dish was bland and required hot sauce (it's a good thing hot sauce is ubiquitous in any nola restaurant) but worst of all the eggs weren't runny! It ended up being a hard boiled egg, tomato, bacon, on a biscuit with hollandaise on top.  

My friend got the eggs cochon with a side of chicken sausage which I sampled.  His eggs also weren't runny but the pork debris was a nice topping making the dish a little less dry.

Benny, Omelets but give me some nasty good shrimp and grits and I will beg like a 2 year old Lab staring down a rib eye.

So let's cut to the chase, this interesting ""BBQ"" shrimp and grits maybe a bit of a misnomer but out of this world.  The shrimp was cooked perfectly.  I always get concerned that folks over cook and I would rather eat a rubber eraser off the end of my ole #2.  This shrimp was moist, great texture and a grilled flavor that was a scrumptious add.  The BBQ sauce was a savory coating of velvet loveliness that I could put on my crusty hat and make it yummy.  If you do order, get the house made biscuit - to die for.  Finally with the outstanding grits that had a creamy yet stable texture made it a home run.

I ordered two eggs over medium, bacon, potatoes, biscuit, and a fried green tomato. The eggs were cooked to perfection, biscuit was delicious, and the fried green tomato was divine. Unfortunately, the potatoes and bacon were not up to par. The potatoes were not very good. The potatoes seemed slightly burned and had no flavor. The bacon was very fatty and could have been cooked longer. The fat was still white. My husband orderer the same thing except his eggs were scrambled. His potatoes and bacon were the same as mine.

I got the Corned Beef Hash to pre-game my main dish with and it was just OK. I actually took a few bites and decided to just pass on it all together and wait for my meal. I ordered the BBQ Shrimp and Grits and it was good. That's just it, good. 

I think the food was good and so were the drinks, but do I think they are wait around the block for an hour good? Maybe not. Service was great and sometimes it is fun to try a touristy spot. So, if you have your heart set on coming to this place and are prepared for the wait, I say go for it!

My friend read through several other reviews on Yelp! that suggested the same and it definitely helped us out.  

Second, come with friends who like to share, because there are so many good things to try here.  My friend and I split the Chicken St. Charles, the Eggs Cochon, a side of the grits, and a side of the breakfast potatoes.  All pretty remarkable.  Also, portions were large and I struggled to finish everything!  Lastly, the brunch cocktails looked deelish, but I opted for the grapefruit juice.

I ordered the Southern Breakfast, which came with 2 eggs, grits w/cheese, a friend green tomato, a biscuit and bacon. OMG!!.it was so tasty and filling for only $9. The biscuit wqs my favorite part. I would say this was my favorite breakfast I had while my trip in the city. 
The prices range from $8-$14 per plate.

v9RVOi2eNYRYgjbMHdS1Wg,dV2ODY9BaJp2c-nnteAhZw,oBNrLz4EDhiscSlbOl8uAw,5,0,0,0,"This was our first meal when in NOLA in early May 2013. We tried to find a few other places via Yelp but they were both closed. This was our 3rd choice and it said it was closing at 2:00. we got there at 1:40 or so.

We got 2 things, 1 recommended by the waitress (and people here) and the catfish special. Because I wanted catfish and it looked good. 

First was the eggs cachon, as recommended by several people and the waitress. This was average. I liked the toasted roll as a base and the meat was obviously well-thought out, but it lacked flavor to bring it all together. The eggs were poached too long so they weren't very runny. And there was too little sauce. On that note, too much meat threw off the balance because it didn't have enough flavor, not enough sauce, and not enough egg yolk. 

I love the concept though. Maybe it was rushed because it was too close to 2:00? We didn't get the feel from anyone working there that this was the case. They were content to let everyone just sit there and enjoy the day. 

Second dish was a catfish special, which had plenty of sauce and some pork and spinach and tomatoes and artichoke hearts and was nothing short of incredible. Go here, get this, if it's on the menu that day.

Overall I'm a fan and it's possible I go back to try the Migas or the lox, but there's so much good food in this city I try not to go back to the same place twice.

In edit - I changed this from a 4 to a 5. After spending 5 days in NOLA I appreciate this place more. The food was fresh and innovative, and in light of everything else we ate it was a 5 star breakfast place. Since it was the first meal we had here it was hard to judge it in any context. After 5 days of fried oysters I realize now this is a bit above & beyond many of the other places here.",2013-05-05 14:40:37

The eggs were cool and thrown haphazardly on the sandwich. The bacon was definitely delicious, but that was the only thing. This was super dry and I would have appreciated a suggestion for a sauce or topping. Even doused in hot sauce this was great.

I was trying to navigate with my phone, holding an umbrella that was ineffective from the wind.  It was a struggle! I admit I got lost but what matters is that I found the place. 

First thing I saw was the freaking line outside.  Since it just me, I didnt think it would be a problem getting a table. 45-minutes later, I sat at the bar.  To say this place was busy is an under statement! I learned while in the plane headed for NOLA, and walking around.  That NOLA is the place for bachelor and bachelorette parties!  So ruby slipper was bustling with the two groups.  Of course a family here and there.  Lucky for me they sat me next to another lone woman. After scrolling through the menu and looking at what others were getting, I decided on Gulf Fish St. Peter.  Everything about that dish was freaking amazing. My tastebud was having party at each bite.  Fish and shimp was soft/tender combined with the crunchiness of the grit cake was texture heaven.  I didnt think I would like the mustard hollandaise but I was wrong. The dish just meshed to form one awesome dish.  

Everyone I encountered there were very nice.  From the waitress, bartender, and hostess.  The woman I sat next too was very nice too.

Another ordered the eggs blackstone, and rather than having it accompanied with biscuits as described in the menu, the ""biscuits"" were like grits in patty form.

Still, for a 70ish% full lunch rush with a theoretically full staff on board, I should NOT have had to stand like an idiot for 5 minutes before seating myself.. had to wipe my own spot at the bar clean before sitting down ... and asked for a menu. At that point I should have just left, but curiosity got the best of me. I waited over 20 minutes to order -- and finally, 20 minutes later my plate was wordlessly left to me by a food runner.

The food was 3-4 stars-worthy. The portions were small, but I much prefer to be served a plate that actually fits in the finite confines of my stomach than the piles of food typically served at your standard greasy spoon. Because let's face it -- I will eat it. 

Biscuits were dry, but the eggs were perfectly poached. Bacon -- obvious ace. Hollandaise -- lacking. The fruit was cantaloupe, watermelon and pineapple -- better than I expected. Overall the staff, when present, were friendly, though clearly rushing. But I left completely underwhelmed, $20 the poorer, with a satisfied stomach and palette, and a somewhat passive desire to try them on another day.

Pros: Delicious food, crazy variations on standard breakfast items
Cons: Really heavy food

Thoughts: The Ruby Slipper is an interesting, and delicious, blend of creole and southern breakfast comfort foods. Most of their menu consists of those amazingly delicious, gut wrecking, artery clogging amazingness (think biscuits, gravy, sauces, fried, and butter). Then, to give it their own unique take on things they add a creole flair to it. For us this meant adding shrimp and andouille sausage to the eggs Benedict and stuffing the french toast with a pineapple cream cheese concoction.

We went here for our final breakfast in NOLA and I feel like that was the best time we could have gone. The breakfast was very heavy and we spent the next few hours walking around the city burning off the breakfast. Heavy DOES NOT equate to bad in any way, in fact the food was delicious. What it means is that you definitely wouldn't want to eat here each day, and you probably wouldn't want to eat here and then sit for a long time, unless you want to fall into a food coma LOL.

Two other couples were seated after us and both were served before us. My mother is diabetic and we informed the staff of this....still no food arrived. A third person sat, ordered and was served...my mother is still waiting. 

When i asked the server about my mothers food...she said okay and commenced to putting away dishes and checking on other customers. Our food arrived before she actually checked. 

I ordered a floretine omelet...i often modify my orders due to food allergies, so i didnt much understand why i couldnt modify my omelet in any way. I simply wanted 2 egg whites and 1 full eggs. My mom also wanted her eggs cooked over medium well (just a little runny egg yolk). They were unable to accomodate either. Rather, they were unwilling to. 

Once the food arrived, neither of us were impressed. I was so disappointed because the reviews were awesome. My mothers eggs were too hard, her fried green tomato was unseasoned. The only redeeming quality was the Ruby Sunrise.

Now, to my surprise the guy next toe noticed me typing my review and asked that i add the wait to get your bill. He mentioned others around us who were seated after us had their bills AND had left. Even as i am writing this, i am waiting for the server to take my payment and EVERYONE who was seated after us (with 10-15 mins) have ALL left.

On our first morning in town we decided to try it out.  We choose it both because it was right across the street from the hotel and also because they seemed to be a popular spot with the breakfast crowd.  I waded through the crowd and the super friendly hostess took my name and said it would likely be 10-15 minutes for a table.  

I wanted something different and local so I went for one of their signature items, the Eggs Cochon.  It starts with a homemade biscuit that's halved, then each half is topped with a pile of pulled pork debris, a poached egg, and finished with hollandaise.  It was freaking great!  The biscuit tasted very fresh and the pork had a nice hint of smoke to it.  The whole thing was just what I needed as a base for a busy day of bar hopping.  I tried their grits and wasn't too impressed, but that didn't take much away from the great meal.  My brother got the Eggs Cochon too and loved it as well, and his wife got the Eggs Coubion.  Hers was ""Thin-fried Mississippi farm-raised catfish over French bread  spears, topped with poached eggs, a sautè of spinach, tomatoes, artichoke hearts and tasso, finished with a Creole tomato Courtbouillon"".  Wow, she shared some of her catfish and it was awesome.  At first it seemed weird to get fish and eggs for breakfast, but after seeing it I could see trying it out sometime.

The next time we had a longer wait, more like 30 minutes.  Probably because we had a couple of more people then, making a party of five.  I went for the Bananas Foster Pain Perdu.  I wanted something sweet and it fit the bill nicely.  They use French bread spears and cover them all with the rum-flambéed bananas & raisins, with some bacon on the side.  It was great!  Everyone else loved their choices too: a couple of Eggs Blackstone, Louisianan omelet, and a Spanish omelet.

I got the simple Ruby's Basic Breakfast, pretty much standard breakfast food after a night out. The only thing I didn't love was the breakfast potatoes, I like them a bit crispier than they were.

Was it worth the wait? 100% yes!

I ordered their signature Ruby Slipper mimosa which was a classic delight. I also ordered the Grilled Fish St. Peter which was fish and grits and a suggestion from our waiter. I also got a side of eggs and a biscuit (greedy, I know, but I needed it!) The  fish n grits was mouth-watering good. The fish was grilled perfectly - juicy, done and not dry! It was a filling dish and every bite was perfect. The eggs were good and the biscuit is a must have! It comes with their house-made honey butter!

My husband ordered two meals (he also needed it lol). He ordered The Peacemaker which lets you choose two of their signature eggs Benedict. He chose Hot-Smoked Salmon Bennie and the Chicken St. Charles. The poached eggs were perfect and the flavors were amazing! He also ordered the Hot-smoked Salmon omelette which he really enjoyed.

""I don't think we're in Louisiana any more"" is what I thought to myself.  With its public commitment to the environment, composting, recycling, and buying locally, the Ruby Slipper seems more like the restaurants back home than those in New Orleans.

As I am not from the South, it also came as a surprise to have a waitress call me, ""Mah dahlin"".  In my book that's good for a few extra points on the tip.

The Bananas Foster French toast was simply the best french toast ever.  I am accustomed to French toast that comes with a heavy syrup that makes my stomach hurt half way through.  No such problem with the Ruby Slipper rendition.  I like French bread, so it only makes sense that French toast from French bread would work well.  

Visually, the Bananas Foster was also a treat.  It has the appearance of three lengthwise slices of banana (the toast) topped with round slices of banana.

But my number one is service, and because the restaurants food is good, it doesn't compare to the way your treated because that has a significant impact on your visit.

We were really excited to try the food cause we had heard such good things about this place. We had bought Starbucks on our way to the restaurant. The hostess told us it would be about 20mins for a table yeah sure fine. Our group of four all had Starbucks in our hands. So it was clearly visible to the young lady we had them.

We waited the 20mins and my friends all finished their Starbucks before me and I still had 2/3 of my latte left. When the hostess sat us down she said ""oh by the way there is no outside drinks allowed"" there all of us were dumbfounded like uhhhhh NOW you tell us? I just spent 6$ on this and she is telling me I can either throw it away or she can hold it at her little host stand. 

I get it you don't want to take away from your business of your crappy auto drip bland coffee but she should have told us to make sure we finished the drinks before we were called in. My friend far from ok with this got a separate cup to put the coffee in so I don't have to throw it away. Of course the hostess being a major B word decided that's not ok and my friend asked for a manager. And I spent four years in food service and I still haven't forgot the days that the customer is always right. But this guy started arguing with us claiming we were verbally 'attacking' him. What? Look if taking away from your business of the Starbucks coffee is threatening to you why is the big deal putting it in a damn cup a problem that has no logo on it? 

In the end the manager caved giving us the cup but by the time we all sat down we were so emotionally withdrawn with two horrible service contacts one including a manager we decided to leave so they didn't spit in our food. By that time after all the arguing I had already finished the latte.

The situation could've been handle so much better then the way they presented it too us. It all started by us checking in, if the hostess told us when we asked for a table to finish before be walked in there would've been NO issue at all.",2015-03-29 01:04:30

The really disappointing part was that they had the same specials all week so there was never an opportunity to try any of their other famed specials.",2012-05-26 19:25:45

I loved the ambiance, the waiters were friendly, and it was just a cool environment!  I ordered the brioche French toast, which came with Applewood bacon.  And I ordered a side of Fried Green Tomatoes.

While there are multiple locations in New Orleans, I went to the Magazine St. location as it was closest to my conference hotel.

Our group of 2 (yes, tiny I know) was promptly sat and we were greeted in seconds by our server Sommer. I'm not a morning person, like at all, so breakfast at 7:15am is more like torture, but our server was so polite and bubbly, it totally set the mood! She quickly got our our coffees and was totally able to read body cues when we were ready to order food. 

I personally had the Peacemaker. I think the Peacemaker was created for people like myself who consider ourselves foodies, but we can't make a damn decision. In essence, the Peacemaker allows you to pick 2 eggs benedict option out of the 8 total options they offer. So one half of my eggs benedict was called the Eggs Cochon (pronounced koe-shawn) and the other half was called the Shrimp Boogaloo. The eggs cochan was delicious, and started with half of a biscuit, shredded pork, a poached egg, and hollandaise sauce. While it was quite tasty, my taste buds exploded when I had the Shrimp Boogaloo! It consisted of shrimp cooked in/with pork and tomato, a fried green tomato, a poached egg, and a delicious buttery, tomato sauce all over a buttermilk biscuit! It was savory, rich, but not overwhelming, and had the perfect amount of seasoning! And I think what really sold it was the fried green tomato!! The fried part didn't fall off when you cut it, and had just the perfect amount of tartness that complemented the richness of the dish. WHO KNEW A GREEN VEGGIE COULD PACK A PUNCH???!!!

Needless to say, I was a really happy person! The only reason I didn't give this place a 5 stars was because the hostesses seemed more concerned about texting or talking among themselves rather than helping us right when we entered, but then again it was 7 in the morning. It would be hard for me to be super attentive at such an ungodly hour.",2016-11-05 19:38:49

Ruby Slipper, no matter the location will keep waiting on line. One of the many highly recommended meals that totally fell short, like most of the others, Ruby Slipper is really no better. 

On our last day in NOLA, we lucked up on the NOWAIT App and were able to skip the line, a tactic that saved us 30+ minutes.  

The hostess (not sure of her name) was amazing - like the best hostess ever known to man! This girl was quick, sugary sweet and professional. I genuinely fell in love with this woman within my first 30 seconds of speaking with her. 

As you wait on line to get in, there is a full menu posted on the outer window. We were seated within 5 minutes so we really didn't get a chance to truly peruse. A gent consistently works the line and gets drink orders for those who'd like a beverage (or four ) while they wait.

We were told the wait was going to be 15 minutes. As there is only one small bench outside to wait (forget about waiting inside, not gonna happen), Hubby suggested we take a short walk around the block. As I was already the gnarly kind of hungry, I made him stand there with me. I'm glad I did, because we were called in about half the time. 

We were given the option to sit at a table or the bar, so we opted for the table, a high two-top next to the bar. We were quickly greeted by our server and our drink orders were taken. The Yelp Bloody Mary certificate was staring at me in the face, demanding that I order the Bacon-Infused Vodka Bloody Mary, so I did as I was told. 

OH.EM.GEE. The bacon bloody mary is SO good. Maybe the best bloody mary I have ever had. It has just the right amount of spice and topped with green beans, lime, olive, lemon, and of COURSE a strip of bacon (Note: No crappy celery stick). I could just drink these all day and be pretty damn happy. Be careful though, that sucker took a long time to creep up on me. I didn't feel it until I stood up to leave, but man, I felt it. Good thing I didn't order a second one!

Our food came out in a fair amount of time. I was, and still am, a little sad that food was not very warm. More like warmish. I had the Eggs Cochon. The biscuit had the perfect texture and just the right size to not overwhelm the dish, the pork debris was sweet and delish underneath the egg, and the hollandaise sauce was divine. But it would have just been so much better if it came out hot. 

Hubby had the Corned Beef Bennie. He also found much joy in the hollandaise sauce, but did comment that he maybe should have tried the chicken. I am not a big fan of corned beef, so I have no comment. 

The service was friendly and wonderful. It was fun watching the bartender pour 17 quarts of vodka into a bucket for the bloody marys. 

Wonderful spot for breakfast/brunch. Take warning, though, the food was so rich and filling that I was only able to finish one of my eggs cochon, but Hubby happily devoured the second one for me after he finished his. I was still full until dinner, so if you are on an eating tour, you will want to plan to share.",2017-07-02 19:40:52

First off the waitress, Teresa was the absolute sweetest, she took time to walk us through the menu and daily specials, while recommending her personal favorites. She was extremely attentive without seeming like she was trying too hard. Let's get to the food, there are soooooooooo many great options on the menu it was hard to choose. They are well known for their benedicts so of course I had to try one, one problem there are so many great options and it's hard to decide. Well problem solved, they offer ""The Trifecta"" which offers three different benedicts, one shrimp that has a fried green tomato, one cochon with braised pork, and one chicken st. Charles (my personal fave). My boyfriend had the stuffed French toast of the day, which was filled with vanilla and cream cheese and top with baked apples, I would like to give more info on that but he devoured it all pretty quickly, so safe to say it was delicious!

Underwhelming. The boiled gulf shrimp were plentiful & plump but flavorless. Cheddar cheese was also lacking is anything resembling flavor...I did see and feel the cheesy gooyieness, just couldn't taste it.  

Potatoes:
Red potatoes, quartered, seasoned and crunchy from the grill.  I would have enjoyed them if served right after they were cooked, but I was 90 minutes too late for that.

Buiscuit:
Cold and Rubbery.  Sounds like from other reviews that the biscuits are real ""hit or miss"" from day to day.   It looked amazing sitting on the plate. I grabbed it to pry it open, anticipating hot, flakey steamy goodness.  Nope. Sad face :(

Grits: 
Delicous and creamy.  
They got cold pretty quickly though, along with everything else.

Going to return another day to try the pancakes, they look phenomenal.",2012-05-14 18:33:25

WOW - The Ruby Slipper totally knocked our socks off! I am always hesitant to try a place that has multiple locations over a place that stands all on its own, but this place absolutely smashed that rule. 

The first thing that really impressed me about the Ruby Slipper was how genuine and friendly the staff all seemed to be. They all were very busy but completely hustling to take care of people. It was sort of a team effort; multiple servers topped off our coffee & water, cleared plates, etc. I think it says a LOT about a hospitality crew when they all work together like that! 

Next up: the beverages. When in NOLA... Well let's just say they go all out with their bloody Mary's. We're talking whole huge strips of bacon, large pieces of lemon and lime, whole veggies pieces... It's like a salad in a boozy, tomato-y cup. Also, the coffee was darn impressive for diner coffee! 

We had the salmon benedict breakfast and the country breakfast. Both were outstanding. And the biscuits.... Ugh, the biscuits. They have absolutely ruined all other biscuits for me. They were just the perfect amount of dense, yet fluffy. Flaky, yet moist. Buttery, but not at all greasy. Just off the charts great biscuits. The grits were super tasty as well with good corn flavor, and not too mushy or sticky. My eggs were cooked exactly how I ordered them, which almost never happens because I have an oddly specific order that most chefs just can't or won't do: 'over hard, fried, dead, browned, solid, cooked all the way through'. Sorry, but that's how I like them! The ruby slipper nailed it. I finished my eggs for the first time in I can't remember how long. Yay! The salmon benedict was just bursting with meaty chunks of smoked-in-house salmon. Really, really nicely done. 

Lastly - for this incredible breakfast experience, the price was very reasonable! About $30 all in for the two of us.

We had the bar seats, and because the majority of us are short, we had fun climbing the chairs and the jumping down from them; of course, we couldn't move our seats closer or further from each other/the bar without fearing we'd tip over, but hey, what's life without a little risk?
The eggs were done perfectly, not undercooked, not overcooked. I loved the slow-cooked pork. It was melt in your mouth perfection.  One bite of that pork and all I could think of was ""diet, what diet?"" 

This is definitely a must try place.  You won't regret it. But beware, it does get crowded and it does get loud.  There is outdoor seating, but that's only if you can handle the heat (and I don't mean the hot sauce, I mean the actual heat).",2015-05-12 01:34:56

We were sleepy and hungry. While scouting a good breakfast/brunch place we met an elderly couple who suggested this place.
Right off the bat, we could sense that this place was in huge demand because there was a queue outside the restaurant and the hostess was taking down everyone's names and phone numbers and telling them to wait for 25-30 mins which is totally normal.
I was given a wait time of 25 mins and I was told that I'm in the queue. I even received a message with a yelp link which allowed me to check my place in the queue. I went away and kept monitoring my place in the queue. And I was back at the restaurant  entrance 5 mins before my waiting time was up & before the app showed 0 parties ahead of me in the queue. I kept waiting patiently for my name to be called out, but that never happened even when the app showed that I'm up next. I was standing right there in front of the hostess. She never called out my name and finally I went up and told her that my waiting period was up already and I've waited an additional 10 mins and still my name hasn't been called. She took down my phone number again and told me to step in and wait there.
Then I waited for another 10 mins inside the entrance of the restaurant, only to be seated at the bar, which was still fine. It was my friend's birthday and I wanted to at least sit at a table with her, but I let it go as both of us were super hungry.
Then we ordered food. The guy who took our order was very enthusiastic and nice and great to talk to.
I read the menu very carefully and ordered an omelette which clearly did not have bacon as one of its ingredients.
I received my food and my omelette was stuffed with tiny pieces of bacon, like the most finely chopped bacon and way too many of those tiny pieces. The guy who had taken our order was very polite and so I didn't complain about the food right then. Plus I was super hungry and didn't want to wait another 20-ish mins just to get the right food. I ate it the way it was, by separating out the bacon pieces as much as I could. I have nothing against bacon, absolutely no restrictions as such but I just choose not to eat any type of red meat. Our interaction with the person who took our order, was the only pleasant part of our experience here.
The food was good. The place was crowded which meant that it was a very sought after brunch place. The ambience was good and easy going.
The restaurant seemed good overall, but I couldn't have a good experience majorly because of the mismanaged queue system and the screw up in my food order.",2018-10-15 22:09:39

At 10:45am on a Saturday morning,we headed over to Ruby Slipper fully expecting to wait for 30-45 minutes. We also knew they had a bar so on a gorgeous Fall day, waiting was not a deal-breaker. The hostess was incredibly sweet and let us know the wait would be 20-30 minutes (even better than expected!). My friend and I headed over to the bar and within 2 minutes our bloody mary's were in production. The bloody's were great, pickled green beans and a good kick, just how I prefer mine! 

Within about 5 minutes two people departed from the first-come bar seating area and my friend and I swooped in - total wait time = 7 minutes. 

I let the hostess know we found a spot at the bar and at that point we were third on her list. Not too shabby for a Saturday brunch downtown. Now, onto the food. We started out with the fried green tomatoes. I don't know what they put in the crust but it was stellar. Not the least bit soggy and I am near certain there was thyme and some other fresh herbs in the breadcrumbs. I went with the Classic Breakfast for my main course and selected the corn beef hash for my meat. It was fresh and a generous serving of meat and potatoes. Served along with eggs, grits and a biscuit - it was more than enough food. 

If you are looking for a well-prepared and simply executed (this is not your fancy plate/sexy garnish type of establishment) breakfast I highly recommend Ruby Slipper. There are options for everyone and the specials change daily.",2012-11-19 19:30:24

Prolific as the New Orleans restaurants are, unless it's a famous place, the good ""local"" places can be hard to find without an assist. Yelp displayed Ruby Slipper as a close breakfast place near the hotel, which actually wasn't too exciting since I already know Ruby Slipper to be somewhat of a chain. Using Waitlist, we got in line online and took our time getting there. There was still a little wait - the customers were crowding the sidewalk and street, even across the street... like waiting to see a band - but not too bad, and well worth it. The wait staff are super friendly. No matter the crowd, they're not freaked out or rushed. Cool cucumbers be they. The food was served quickly, but again, not rushed. The place was filled up at 10am. While waiting outside, they take drink orders to help tame the otherwise ravenous savagery of hungover partiers. Bloody Marys with bacon were everywhere. Were I not with my son, I might have partaken. The coffee was great, but even bad coffee in New Orleans is better than anywhere you're drinking it. My son had two pancakes (yum - I tried them and recommend them) that hung lazily over his plate accompanied with scrambled eggs (good) and smoked bacon (me making Homer Simpson noises) and a hot chocolate. I had the southern breakfast. Good scrambled eggs, creamy and delicious grits, a biscuit that weighed a pound and a memorable slice of fried green tomato. The biscuit kept me fed all day.

The hostess treated me like a nuisance and the manager failed to alleviate the situation. A great disappointment for a well know restaurant with a beautiful ""there is no place like home"" story.

The first impression:
 Their wait time is atrocious - make sure you call ahead or use the waitlist feature on yelp. We used the yelp waitlist and were able to walk in without an issue. If you're in a party of 3 or less, just go ahead and take a bar seat. It's very open concept and WORTH it. You'll get better conversation with the bartenders, your drinks (alcoholic or nonalcoholic) will come out faster, and there are three TVs hanging strategically so you can watch the games from any position at the bar. Also the noise level was lower at the bar than the floor seats. 

The food: 
  We got The Trifecta and The Skinny Florentine. The Skinny Florentine tasted extremely light, save the healthy portion of goat cheese in the middle otherwise a very good omelette. The Trifecta was chicken Benedict, pulled pork Benedict, and a shrimp Benedict. In my personal opinion, the chicken was the best tasting one, although two out of three eggs were over cooked and the pulled pork was a little dry. The bottoms of the benedicts were biscuits instead of English muffins, so they have the potential to be a very thick dish. However, as far as the eggs, people sitting near us got perfectly cooked eggs on their Benedicts, so it was probably just a mistake. 

The service: 
 They were military friendly, extremely attentive, answered all our questions, and made small talk that was inviting. Ended up getting a discount and several dinner recommendations from our server. 

4.5 out of 5, would definitely come here again!",2017-12-24 19:00:41

And, at least for us, the line moved pretty fast.  It might have been longer if we had demanded a table, but my friend and I were happy to take stools at the bar.  And thank goodness we did, because our stool neighbors informed us that the first parade of Mardi Gras was that night.  Had we not run into them, we may never have known because our hotel sure didn't tell us.  (Funny story, we ran into those same guys and their wives later that night after the parade.  Small world!)

Beverage-wise we ordered hot tea, a bellini, and a bloody mary.  The bellini was ho-hum.  The sip I had of my friend's bloody mary was excellent.  And, she loved the spicy green beans that were in it so much that she bought a jar.  Yes, you can buy a jar of spicy green beans here.  How fantastic is that?!

I ordered the migas.  So yummy.  Not super spicy, but it had a little kick.  I had to stop myself from inhaling everything on my plate, because it tasted so good but was a giant portion.  Friend got the eggs blackstone and they were delicious as well.  And they came with fresh fruit that she was kind enough to share with me.  I was intrigued by the BBQ shrimp and grits (love shrimp and grits), but wasn't feeling it for breakfast.  Maybe next time, because I know I will certainly be back on future visits to NOLA.

To top off the great experience, our bartender/server was super friendly and also pretty easy on the eyes.

I was recently in New Orleans for a work conference. My first time in New Orleans, I skipped Ruby Slipper because their line was crazy long. I was pleasantly surprised when my coworker friends called and said they were seated promptly, menus in hand. It was a less busy time of the morning. 

When I arrived, I was greeted by the hosts and let them know that my party was already seated. I found my friends center of the dining room, I took a seat, and browsed the menu. 

Their server approached the table and quickly informed me that ""there are no joiners."" She repeated this line several times before I realized what she meant. I said, ""Ok. That's fine."" I smiled passive-aggressively and proceeded to find loopholes to this ridiculous rule. (I thought, surely she doesn't expect me to just sit here and watch my friends eat). I ordered at the bar and clumsily walked back and forth from the bar to my friends' table. 

Another server brought my food from the kitchen. He explained the ""no joiners"" rule, which is in place to to minimize confusion on their busier mornings. My friends' server continued to check on my friends, but she did not look at me, ask how my food was, did not ask if she could bring anything. I didn't even get coffee or water. We had zero contact for the duration of breakfast.

My first impression of this restaurant was a server telling me no. She did not offer any solutions on how I could be served. It seemed like she might have look around, saw they weren't swamped, and thought of how she could have said ""yes"" that day.",2017-06-03 22:47:46

In NOLA. The Ruby Slipper serves up one hell of a meal that fuses Cajun Classics with all your brunch favorites. The place is actually situated in an old bank building that is rumored to have been robbed by Bonnie & Clyde.

First up, and perfect for kickstarting any brunch, the Bloody Mary is legit the best I have ever had. I find that most bloody Mary's tend to either be under seasoned, too watery, or too cold. But this one suffered from none of those. It had a thick consistency, and the perfect blend of spicing, pepper and horseradish, as well as taking compliments from a rasher of bacon, pickled dilly bean and olive. Seriously tasty, and you also get a choice for it to be made with either normal or bacon vodka. Rave reviews and we're only at the drink!

Foodwise, like I mentioned, it's Cajun classics fused with Brunch. Think blackened shrimp Benedict, red beans and rice hash, and pulled pork stuffed omelette. I had probably one of the best sounding (and tasting) brunch dishes I've ever had - Catfish tails with deep fried shrimp grits, served on a bed of tomatoes and spinach, with a grilled shrimp skewer and Mustard Hollandaise - seriously, I do not have one bad thing to say about this dish, and special shout out to the deep fried shrimp grits.

The noise level was a cacaphonic din. The wait staff was decently efficient given the noise and crowded furniture and press of customers. The menu choices were sufficient and varied. The wait for the food was longer than I expected. Upon arrival, the food was slightly shy of Danny's standards. My wife's pancakes were raw in the center.  They were banana-pecan. This was a one dollar premium. Instead of the bananas and pecans in the batter,  there were two thin slices of banana and a teaspoon of crushed pecans strewn on top. They were served with three small pieces of fruit. . My fried green tomato wasn't served until several minutes after the rest of my breakfast. The crust on the tomato was tough,  dried out,  like warm. My scrambled eggs were lumpy and lukewarm. My biscuit was heavy, of little taste and tough and rubbery. My bacon was soggy and cold.  The monkey bowl of fruits was pretty good.  Lumpy but taste. Overall the food was on the poor side of mediocre.",2015-03-30 22:38:36

There are several locations around town and this was an easy walk from our hotel in the business district. The cafe utilizes No Wait , and I'd recommend using it as the area around the hostess stand is pretty crowded and no wait keeps you out of the crowd. 

The cafe is small and probably not a great choice for large groups. 

My husband ordered an Irish coffee and I had a Bellini. My Bellini was a little strong, but that's more on me than the restaurant. I'm pretty picky. I orders the Cochon Benedict and our waitress let us know that you can split the benedicts. I opted to order half a Cochon Benedict and half a corned beef Benedict. My husband did the same and added an order of hash. 

The food was a little slow to come out, but not overly. It arrived hot and well plated. The breakfast potatoes were good. I wasn't a huge fan of the hash. It was just okay. The corned beef Benedict was extremely good. The eggs were perfectly poached with runny centers. The hollandaise was very good as well. I ended up not liking the Cochon Benedict as much.

It's so good that when me and my friend went there was a good thirty minute wait to get into the packed, tiny diner so be prepared for that but I assure you it's worth the wait. And while you're doing so there is a bar with probably the best mimosa's I've ever tasted. Be warned, it's a little pricey!!!

When we got in and sat down, ordered our food and were given different sets of beverages you could just tell that everyone loved working here, and that the customers were really enjoying themselves. It's incredibly laid back; something that legitimately surprised me after living here for three years and trying a handful of different restaurants. 

The food was delicious and you could tell that the chefs really put their heart into their craft. My only complaint was that the bread on my plate was a bit stale and hard to bite into; but everything else on the plate was so delicious that it was easy to leave it behind.

I'm in training.""  A few minutes later, the other guy came over and asked us what we wanted to order, even though we didn't get our drinks yet.  Our drink order was never relayed.

My entree, the Three Little Pigs omelet, was cooked well and generously filled with bacon, ham, and sausage.  The biscuits were very good, and the Irish coffee was a hell of a way to wake up!

My husband's entree was brought out incorrectly.  Twice.  It wasn't a special order by any means.  He ordered eggs over easy, they gave him scrambled.  He asked for a biscuit, they gave him toast.  No apology, no ""I'll get that taken care of right away,"" no attention to detail or service at all.

We took our place in the 30-45 min. line and waited with the other loiterers outside. Three years ago we were told to try this little place called  ""the Ruby Slipper"" for breakfast...now they have several locations. This trip we were excited to find a location near our hotel the Marriott JW but we had a plane to catch. Still, we felt determined to complete our mission. I was pretty surprised that there was not a solid fried oyster option on the menu, although the menu did offer many delicious options with easy pricing. I wanted to order the fried chicken breast with hollandaise sauce on poached eggs etc. etc. but I chickened out no pun intended. I ordered the bacon lettuce tomato fried green tomato sandwich on toasted brioche roll with shoestring french fries. Because it was breakfast and because of other reasons that are obvious I ordered a over easy fried egg to go with the sandwich. Even before the fried egg sandwich was too big to eat as a sandwich. It was delicious and every way and if it were not for the guy sitting next to me at the counter eating the fried chicken with sauce and poached eggs I may have been completely satisfied.

Ordered an omelette the print out didn't show goat cheese. Then the omelette shows up and doesn't have the right ingredients. Dude goes and asks for another omelette vs. asking us how to proceed. When two people get food eating separately is annoying. Then the bill comes and they don't comp the food or anything. I think you missed the mark on customer service and if you are going to have build your own omelettes you either get the order correct or remedy the mistake to the customers liking. I don't think comping an omelette that is incorrect isn't unreasonable. I would have left a five star rating as mistakes happen and I am all about giving the restaurant an opportunity to handle.

Knowing this, my wife and I went there right after it opened at 7:00 AM. It helps when we stay across the street and we can see the place from our room. It gets crowded quickly.

My wife ordered the Peacemaker, where you can pick 2 items from their eggs Benedict menu. She got the eggs Cochon and the Shrimp Boogaloo.

The pork was done very well. It was rich, and the flavor was great. The Shrimp Boogaloo was not so much shrimp, but more fried green tomato. We both agree that we wouldn't pick that one again.

I ordered the Chicken St. Charles, after seeing a number of positive reviews. It was very good. The chicken was tender and flavorful. This is a definite go to if you're looking for something savory and can't decide what to pick. 

The coffee was nothing spectacular. My wife ordered a cup and it was lacking flavor. I'm a fan of dark roast, so I found the coffee wanting. I ordered a cold brew iced coffee and felt I should have just stuck with the water. 

The server will want your full order since they may not allow additions later on because of the crowds. I was thinking about getting French toast, but wanted to see if I was still hungry after the other dishes. 

Now the reason I did not give a 4th star is that we felt that we were a bit rushed to finish up and leave. I understand that a restaurant wants to turn over tables, but part of the dining experience is to enjoy your time in the restaurant too. It is a very beautiful setting, but I didn't feel welcome to stay and enjoy. Mind you, I wasn't planning on spending my day sitting around and lazing away, but when I don't feel welcome, why stick around.

Overall, food is good, very crowded so get there early, and be prepared to be ushered out as soon as possible.

They have an extensive menu for hearty, meaty breakfast lovers, vegetarians, and those searching for lighter fare. The prices are great for the enormous quantity of food you get. I have gotten the Florentine omelet every time and I will probably continue to do so for all eternity.

I also could've used a little more cinnamon, but that's just my personal preference. If you can make a reservation on the app, do so.

My boyfriend and I visited from California and went to Ruby's twice during our stay. The first visit was to the Ruby's on Decatur Street. We waited about 10-15 minutes. Not too bad. We were greeted by our waitress, I wish I could remember her name, but she was great! Very warm and welcoming. I got the eggs chacon, I believe that's how it's spelled and my boyfriend got the Benedict with fried chicken. The fried chicken was bland and boring to us. We weren't too thrilled so my boyfriend decided to not eat it and ordered what I ordered since we were both drooling over it. We left and promised we'd return again before we left. We decided to visit this Ruby's and were extremely disappointed with the quality of service we had received. We arrived at about 10am on a freezing 45 degree morning and the wait this time was nearly an hour. I had reserved us a table for a party of four on the app. Our two friends hadn't arrived by the time our table was called and they began to inform us that they could not seat us since our full party was not there yet. I've never ran across a policy so strict. It really made me feel like Ruby's was only after the dollar sign. They want to push in and out as many customers as possible instead of seating those that have already made reservations and sat out in the cold for an hour. We decided to just seat the 2 of us hoping that they would still serve them anyways when they arrived. Once they arrived they denied them entry to us and our waiter said even if they come in he will not serve them. I was hoping for the southern hospitality when visiting Nola for the first time. And while the first experience was great the second one left a bad taste in our mouths. Needless to say we up and left and promised not to return again to give them our money. We're from California where hospitality is little to none but we have not once encountered such a ridiculous policy towards a paying customer.",2018-11-11 05:39:35

The first day we were walking towards the restaurant and saw a bunch of people outside. Oh no, is this a line?  Yep it was, and we were starving. It was a little later in the morning. About 10 am and we thought about bailing. However the grumbling in my stomach told me these people are waiting for a reason so we shall wait too. 45 min later we were seated. 

The first day as it was almost 11, I decided to go with a lunch type food and ordered the Rubyn which is served on a marble rye bagel. It was so good and the side of fries were awesome as well however seeing my girlfriends Bannas Foster Pain Perdu, I instantly fell into a pit of despair. We enjoyed the meal however after my taste of her breakfast made a resolve so deep it could not be broken. 

Rise and shine wood chuck chuckers. 

Next day we left our hotel at 6:45 to be there when the doors opened at 7. We were the first people seated and there was no line. Didn't start getting crowded till about 8. 

This time I made the best decision of my breakfast eating life and had the Bananas Foster and lions and tigers and bears, oh my, it was phenomenal. 

The waitresses were awesome both days and we have since started looking at real estate in the area because with these ruby slippers there's no place like home.",2014-08-10 22:41:36

We went to two separate locations- the Canal Street and the Magazine Street-and both were fun, upbeat kind of places with outdoor seating at the Canal Street location. Just cool little spots. 
It is known for a few things, one of which is the unique and amazing eggs benedict they have. There was a fried chicken breast, a salmon, a debris-pork type....and I can't remember the rest, but ALL of them were awesome. Because you get two, they let you mix and make so the BF and I got to try 4. I don't think I could pick a favorite but I think the BF liked the salmon the best. They range between 13-15 dollars, which may sound a little steep to some, but it was a mountain of food. Both time the BF and I spilt one order. $15 for a breakfast is more than worth it. We got potatoes and fried green tomatoes, and even though they weren't anything fancy, we both remarked at how good the potatoes were. Really, everything was fantastic.

The atmosphere was pleasant. Casual and busy... nice city feel. I sat at the bar inside but the place was cool and breezy. Wish the music in the background had been a little louder, but the lively chatter from the patrons made up for it. 

The Ruby Slipper mimosa was just okay. I wouldn't order it again... it was missing something. I asked for ice and it tasted a bit better. I think the champagne being at room temperature didn't help... perhaps more pomegranate? Everyone seems to order one, but they are slow to be drained. The plastic wine glass made the glass look dirty but I don't think it was. 

The French toast was tasty and done as well as expected. Nothing new or fancy but it tasted good. 

Now I eat a plant based (mostly vegan) diet so I don't know if it's because I hadn't had bacon in over a year, but the applewood-smoked bacon was really good! Wish the dish had come with more than two slices. I was tempted to order a side but resisted temptation!!

My favorites are def the Chicken St Charles and the eggs benedict with smoked brisket! The eggs are poached perfectly. Dip the meat into the runny yoke with some Crystal's hot sauce!

I decided not to let these details weigh on my opinion too much since they seemed overwhelmed with the amount of people waiting.

The food was very good and reasonably priced. We ordered french toast and a southern style chicken sandwich. The toast was soft without being soggy, and came with tasty candy bacon. The sandwich was delicious. The chicken was spiced wonderfully and the brioche bread was a nice added flavor. I overheard a waitress telling a customer that she recommended one side of the menu over another, which I understand after our order. They're renowned for their benedicts and dessert breakfast more than anything. While our food was very good, I wish we had ordered some staple items. The coffee served when you're seated is bigger than the to-go cups we had and the same price. Kind of felt a little let down by that, but overall, this restaurant is worth the hype.

They have a bunch of these, consisting of buttermilk biscuits, topped with poached eggs, some kind of delicious meat (corned beef, pork debris, fried chicken, ...), and some kind of sauce (hollandaise, pork tasso cream sauce, horseradish cream, ...).

I ordered my standard breakfast - two eggs over medium, corned beef hash, potatoes, and got the biscuit.  The bf ordered pancakes and fruit and grits.  I got two eggs over easy plus all the rest of my order at a temperature that was luke warm. The biscuit was probably from scratch, but not particularly good.  Likewise, the corned beef hash was made in house (according to the menu), but overly salty, and without that good melded flavor that the potatoes and beef should get from cooking together with a binder (and also not that good luke warm).  Bf got pancakes that were burnt on the bottoms, artificial maple syrup, and fruit.  The grits never showed up, but were still on the bill.

Service was friendly enough.  Tea was an uninspired tea bag and cost as much as the corned beef hash ($2.50), which was a very bad deal - go with the mimosas, like everyone else said. Skip the tea and the corned beef hash. And probably the eggs, if you're picky about how they're cooked.

Whether I show up with a group, or I stop by alone to eat at the counter, the staff here are incredibly friendly. Most of them even remember me and my friends that come to visit. 

I love the Migas plate. Eggs scrambled with chorizo atop tortilla chips and with melted shredded cheese. The plate also includes sliced fresh avocado, pico de gallo, and a chipotle sour cream. I'd like to get a side of bacon. The bacon is cooked perfectly, and it isn't too salty. The coffee is a local brand, it isn't too bitter or too strong. I always get a cup to go when I leave. 

If you don't like waiting or dealing with crowds, my friends and I will often plan to arrive right when they open on a Saturday morning at 8am. However, I would definitely tell you that this place is worth a wait.

Let's just say that they did NOT live up to Julie's standard or the quality of food at your location.

After this waiter I asked about ordering finished washing glasses & silverware he did take order, but I guess he was mad because we complained. Quick order, rude waiter, took another 30 minutes to get food. Then had to ask for coffee refill! Laid the ticket on bar & never asked if we wanted anything or if order was ok...I had to ask another waiter to take our payment!

Turns out it was the former.  Although we had about a 45 minute wait to sit (group of 9), the time flew by between the outside conversation with friends and the waitress they send around to those waiting outside for drink orders.  The Bloody Mary is a must.  A nice twist on the traditional Bloody Mary with a house mix and nice garnish of lime, a seasoned string bean, queen olives, and one or two giant pieces of bacon.  The service was great, and if you're lucky enough to draw Devin, he's pretty hysterical.  The menu offers a mix of what you would expect to find at any breakfast place (omelette, eggs Benedict, etc.), but also offers New Orleans/Southern-style dishes like chicken biscuits and gravy and shrimp and grits.  Highly recommend The Peacemaker, which is a pick-two option for Ruby Slipper's take on eggs Benedict.  Pictured in the review is the Eggs Blackstone (applewood smoked bacon and grilled tomato served on a buttermilk biscuit topped with 2 poached eggs and hollandaise sauce) and the Hot Smoked Salmon Bennie (hot smoked salmon served on top of a buttermilk biscuit topped with 2 poached eggs, finished with red onion, flash-fried capers and a dill hollandaise).

I was able to indulge in the bananas and pecans and also the pralines and pecans pancakes. The servings were humongous. I don't know if anyone should eat that many pancakes in one sitting.

The shrimp and grits and the cat fish and grits were really good. My favorite was the fish and grits. They are both served with a humongous biscuit with some type of sweet honey butter which was fabulous.


I also tried the peach Balenie. It was not good to me. Neither was the Mamosa. I think the type of wine ruined it. The sweet tea and lemonade was really thin almost taste like water with a tiny bit of tea.  I would stick to the sodas.

Overall, the experience was so good the first time, we had to come back a second and a third time. 

The second time we went I built my own omelet and had double the grits (duh) but it was the third time back that stole the show. Let's talk about the Chicken St. Charles and how it was a symphony in my mouth. The chicken was done exactly how chicken in the south should be done - fried to perfection - crispy on the outside, moist (bad word I know, but apropos) and delicious on the inside.  Add an egg, sauce and put it on a monster biscuit and you've found the star of your show. 

These are only a few of the dishes on their extensive menu and I have no doubt that the next time I visit New Orleans it'll be a Ruby Slipper everyday kind of trip. 

5 stars - great service, awesome atmosphere, amazing food. I went back three times, joined the rewards program, and bought a t-shirt that should tell you something.",2019-05-30 18:15:02

I tried to cut the biscuits (3 halfs on my plate and 2 halfs on my husband's plate) and literally could not get the knife through them. We just ate some of what was on top of the biscuits. Did not care for the shrimp. They tasted frozen, not fresh. How hard can it be to test a biscuit when the batch comes out of the oven? Too many other places to take a gamble here. Two stars for the latte, zero stars for the food and the server's reaction ""Really? We bake them every hour"". Even more reason to get them right. Wow.",2019-01-24 00:17:47

The food was really good. Ordered the stuffed french toast - too much sugar on top but you'll like it if you love it sweet. The fried chicken sandwich was delicious as was the St Charles. My daughter loved the french toast batons. Coffee was kinda weak. They were very accommodating of our special dietary needs though, which was nice.

My cousin and I had been looking forward to trying this highly sought after breakfast joint that is blocks from the French quarter. We'd been bamboozled!! 

So they do have a waitlist feature on yelp you can do-very convenient and we were seated within five minutes of us arriving. Five stars for that.  Once seated, we ordered drinks-big easy mimosas, one reg and one pomegranate- then perused over the menu to make a decision about the best way to satisfy our cravings. We make our order. Then wait, and wait, and wait some more. What I can good about the wait is that the mimosas were delicious and not weak at all. We sipped while pondering over if they had to go slay a pig and grab the eggs from the coup in order to make our meals. It's only breakfast!! 

Our meals finally arrive- I had the Costa Rican and my cousin had the French toast batons (which were swimming in syrup), grits, bacon, and eggs-yes she was hungry. The meals were ok to good but not spectacular and worth the hype or wait a typical person would have to endure.

We ended up waiting 30 minutes for our food from the time we ordered. Sure, it was busy, but so were most of the places that we ate at in the city. Seems to me that the longest wait for all of our meals shouldn't have been for eggs and bacon. When we asked the bartender about the wait, he made the obligatory walk to the kitchen and said it would be out soon but didn't seem too concerned with it being too long. People around us ordered after us and received their food before us and we never even got any kind of apology or concern. Don't get me wrong, my wife and I have worked in restaurants and know that things can happen in the kitchen to delay food getting out, but someone checking on us without our having to ask would've been nice.

Next up, breakfast. The plentiful selection of signature Egg Benedict's made it difficult to make a choice. Thankfully, they have The Peacemaker. This allows you to mix and match any of their signature Benedicts. Perfect.

Eggs Cochon-Delish. Apple braised pork on a buttermilk biscuit, poached  eggs & hollandaise sauce. Sooo good.
Hot Smoked Salmon Bennie-hot smoked salmon over buttermilk biscuit, poached eggs, red onion, flash fried capers & dill hollandaise. Good, but I found the Eggs Cochon more flavorful. Plus, I was too full to eat both.

Service:
Sat at the bar all by my lonesome because Josh G. was busy at a conference. Waitress was very sweet & attentive. Helpful too! Helped me decide between two different catfish dishes & boy, was I happy to take her advice. 

Prices:
The Catfish St. Peter was about $15 while the other catfish dish was $14. Most of the meals hover around $10-15 & the drinks were anywhere from $3-7. 

Total bill was $27 (catfish + Bloody Mary) including tax & tip. Not a cheap brunch, but absolutely delicious. 

Food:
How do I put this without sounding like a real twat? Ummm, yeah unavoidable sooooooOooOo my mouth was having a mouthgasm. The explosion of umami from the cheesy grits & hollandaise sauce was magnificent. It was like a symphony of beautiful melodies coming together as one, like Beethoven's Fifth. You've got creole flavors, spinach, tomatoes, cheesy grits in pan-fried triangles, pan-seared catfish, 3 shrimps lightly grilled on a skewer, perfectly poached eggs, & a creamy hollandaise sauce to top. It was the best damn brunch I've ever had & the first catfish & grits brunch I've ever had. If you're a fan of grits, poached eggs, & catfish, you must try their Catfish St. Peter. A first time trip to NOLA cannot go without trying TRS. 

Environment:

Later we got bloody Mary's and they were, in gag inducing fashion, literally just tomato juice, ice and vodka - so gross.

So the line will be long. Thats pretty much a given.  Its more a Tourist spot then anything else. Eggs will be eggs and bacon will be bacon, i dont care what fancy name you give it.

The shrimp and grits was phenomenal and I might just think about it daily until I have it again. Perfect Cajun, a great portion and overall the service and atmosphere was great. 
The biscuits were also incredible and super dense. I have never picked up a heavier biscuit. Do yourself a favor and wait the 10 minutes to have a delicious brunch.

We are visiting NOLA and had bookmarked all places we wanted to visit, and were looking forward to this place. Unfortunately, this place was a mistake and we definitely should have gone somewhere else. 

Everywhere else we've visited has been such a hit, with warm and friendly service, but not here. 

First, we were seated at the bar, which is not an issue if bartender pays attention to newly seated guests. Next, we had to wait quite long to get our drinks but no water which we'd requested. Had to flag down second bartender and ask for water, which he went to grab the glass to refill, and only then realized there were no glasses to begin with! 

When tried to order the food, they'd run out of two items I wanted to try, which was fine. But the way information was delivered seemed like I was inconveniencing them by ordering items they don't have on purpose. 

Once our food arrived, we got no check backs from either bartender - though white guy on my left got two in the time we were sitting there, as well as elder white couple to our right also got several. 

At the end of the meal, we had to once again, flag down the bartender to have our card swiped. 

The most lackluster service I've ever received. I shall use this as an example of what not to do when training our own servers. 

Food was great, the biscuits were so warm and tasty! Definitely would go to a different location for food, but will be avoiding this place and telling everyone else to do the same!",2019-06-19 21:13:24

The menu was extensive, but had all the breakfast essentials. Most of the group did the mix and match with the egg Benedicts. They were hit or miss depending on which Benedict you chose. 

Food takes a while to come out, probably because they're so busy. Service is lackluster and sometimes rude. We heard our waitress yelling at a couple behind us because they wanted to switch tables since their fan wasn't working.

Our seats were uncomfortable, food was ehhhh, and everything just underwhelming considering all the good things we heard.

The line is usually wrapped around the building but moves quickly.  Once you check in, they will text you the link to the NoWait app if you want to keep an eye on your spot in line.  Otherwise, they will call your name when your table is ready.  There is indoor and outdoor seating and there are heating lamps for outdoor seating; however, they did not keep the customers warm.  I recommend outdoor seating when the weather is warmer.  

Of course I reviewed all the pictures and most of the reviews on Yelp prior to arrival; therefore, I had an idea what I wanted to order.  The prices are reasonable and the portions were adequate.  I ordered the Eggs Cochon ($13) and had sautéed spinach added to it and I also ordered the Bananas Foster Pain Perdu ($11).  Yes, I was being greedy and I could not finish it...but I tried! Lol. 

Eggs Cochon - the biscuit was very flaky and buttery, the pork was very tender with lots of flavor, the egg was fried to perfection (I don't like poached eggs) land the hollandaise was creamy and cheesy. 

Bananas Foster - the bread was soft and fresh, there were a lot of raisins but very few bananas; however, the rum sauce was very nice, it was thick with a little cinnamon and nutmeg flavor, yum!.  And it came with two slices of bacon on the side.  The bacon was nice and crispy just like I like it.

I also ordered a mimosa and asked for more champagne that OJ and our waitress informed me it is a double mimosa but she would make it a triple! And at no additional charge! She made a new friend that day...lol. It was great!.  

My other friend ordered a short stack of buttermilk pancakes (2/$7) which were golden brown and fluffy. She really enjoyed them.  And the other had the Gulf Fish St. Peter ($15).  The presentation was awesome and the smell was even better.  She killed that plate! So I guess it was good.

I ordered the Eggs Blackstone, the biscuit was soft on the inside and toasted buttery on the outside. The bacon was nice and crisp!! The eggs was poached perfectly when I popped the egg the egg yolk streamed right down to the biscuit. The star of the show was the grilled tomato, anyone who knows me knows I hate eating tomatoes but boy was that tomato one of the juiciest, best tomato steaks I ever had.

The host was friendly and got us two seats at the bar right away (no open tables available). My friend and i sat at the bar, it looks like it was busy/short staffed that day. We were totally cool with waiting a bit to get service. It took our bartender server 8 minutes to greet us. We placed our full order right away and asked for two glass of water when she had a chance (she never gave us water). Our food came, it was delicious but we left unhappy because both of the bartenders never checked on us, asked us if we need a refill on our drinks, never gave us water until we asked for a second time, they also didn't check on other people of color guests around the bar either. Are they racist? I'm not sure. 

My friend and i are also in the industry, so we understand how tired/hard it is after a busy lunch rush. But a simple greeting from our server, water, a simple check back would totally be enough for us. All those take only a few second to do. I hope other people won't get the same service as we did (or lack of). I would be willing to give other locations a chance. Unfortunately this visit left us a bitter taste in our mouths.

Checked in online and ate outside which was a very good experience.  I have nothing negative to say about the restaurant itself or the food, but I am disappointed in the experience I had paying the bill.  I paid with  an American Express Gift Card.  I didn't want the tip to be on this card, so I gave Chris a $5 tip cash instead of adding it to my card.  I told Chris that and he thanked me.  My bill was $30.49 and that was the amount I signed for.   Last night I checked my card balance online and was surprised to see the amount $35.49 subtracted from my card instead of $30.49.   Why was $5 more added to my card without my knowledge?    I wasn't offered a receipt and I am surprised that I didn't ask for one.

I got the pacemaker, chicken St. Charles & shrimp boogaloo Benedict.

Chicken St. Charles - the poached egg was a little over done. The fried chicken was also a little overdone and dry. With the addition of the biscuit, everything felt one note. 

Shrimp boogaloo - the egg was perfectly runny on this one. The shrimp was a little over done for this one as well. I was not a fan of the fried green tomato because the batter got soggy with the sauce. I feel like if they grilled the tomato, it would be a lot better. You can get a little bit of the char from grilling it to add a smoky flavor to it. 

The biscuits was probably one of the thing I liked most about both Benedicts. It was soft and buttery. The top layer is crunchy and remained crunchy despite the sauces. What really gave the biscuit the extra ""umf"" was the cinnamon butter. The cinnamon butter isn't too sweet and the cinnamon was not overpowering.

Cinnamon Swirl pancake was hands down the best. It wasn't too sweet but had the perfect amount of cinnamon sweetness to it and it was just fantastic.

Also, the food came out lukewarm and sloppy presentation. 

If you do go here, definitely reserve your place in line on yelp. If we didn't we probably would have had to wait an extra 30 mins to 1 hr. Which is crazy. This restaurant is definitely very touristy, but wanted to try it since it was walking distance from our hotel. They have another location down the street so they do a lot of business. To me the food wasn't good enough for the wait or the price. I'll pass and don't recommend it.",2018-04-30 23:21:20

Friendly staff and cool menu/offerings is a huge score.  I loved being able to be added to wait list via Yelp AP cuz when we arrived and saw the sea of folks waiting .. it was maybe a 5 min wait before we were escorted in.. nice!

Southern breakfast was good.. biscuit was light, fried green tomatoes refreshing and I loved the scrambled eggs - best I've had! (only tip is the recommended  candied/maple bacon and cheese on the grits weren't worth the slight uncharge).

Can't go wrong with The Miga breakfast - it was simple and packed with flavor.  

The Bloody Mary (I'm told) was good and my mimosa was huge n hit the spot however, The black coffee was a watered down miss .. oh well.

I think that I was told 30min.  Staff floats around outside to take drink orders while you wait.  Our party assembled and we got our table around the 30min mark.  The menu (see photos) consists of breakfast and brunch fare.  Think shrimp and grits, eggs/omelets/migas, blt, burgers, french toast, pancakes, sausage/bacon, hash, killer egg benedicts, coffee/tea, cocktails, and juices.  Most people will find something that they would like.  Our group had a good variety of dishes including benedicts, pancakes, shrimp & grits.

After settling down at the Country Inn & Suites, a hunger for Breakfast developed as the Complimentary Breakfast was over @9:30 am, I had to look for outside alternatives under the ultra-strong-UV-radiation that is the New Orleans scorching Sun.  

Not far away resides Ruby Slipper Cafe which has somewhat English Pub-like exteriors however the insides look completely Long Weekend Brunch at the Cottage relax feel.... Aside from the CNN news Stocks watch on the Flatscreen that is.

Took a seat near the Kitchen/Washroom/Bar area to ponder if I should have Savoury(Shrimp & Grits) or Sweet as first meal of the day.  The MALE server was quite useful pleasant overall while the other ladies seem slightly on-edge for some odd reason.  Unlimited refill Coffee($2.00) kept pouring like Niagara Falls from the Dude without asking, sweet.

SWEET, yes that's what I'll get...

Bananas Foster Pain Perdu($11.00)  -

""Pain Perdu"", or lost bread, is a French Bread-based French Toast served with Applewood smoked Bacon and topped with our Bananas Foster topping.

French Bread was unexpected as I usually vision Baguettes to have a hard outer shell but this was soft and the French Toast application was done well.  The Bananas didn't seem to be cooked down at all as from the Bananas Foster method while the Powder Sugar dusting onto the Foster Sauce made the PS crunchy like eating Granulated Sugar by itself.

We wanted a good authentic New Orleans breakfast so after seeing the reviews, we decided to go here. We thought we were in for a treat but this turned into the worst breakfast I had ever had. 

First, the food took a while to come out. Then when it did, my friend got the wrong omelet. She bit into it and told the waitress it was wrong. They took FOREVER bringing out the correct omelet. Then when that came she said it was nasty. We spoke to the manager and she then recommended a third dish. My friend said this was better than the Mexican omelet but not the best. So, out of three tries, the amigo breakfast but the best - but it was still mediocre. 

I got the catfish and grits. The grits were plain underneath, no butter, salt or pepper or cheese. The fish was barely seasoned and the sauce on top was not enough. I had to ask for extra to try and her some flavor. When I mentioned to this manager, she said she knew the seasoning was low on the food and that was HER number one complain. MA'AM.. Smh

Lastly, my sister got the meal with three different biscuits and she for hers comped because it wasn't good, either.

Word has clearly gotten around about this place because the lines are tremendously long. If you're not a fan of waiting outside in the summer heat (as I am), PLEASE take the advice of fellow Yelpers - sacrifice just a little bit of space on your smartphone and download the NoWait app, which allows you to remotely hold a place in line from the comfort of your air-conditioned space. My husband and I were in a hotel a block away and just walked out to the restaurant when we were shown as 'fifth in line'. It was incredibly easy and made me wonder why on earth people would choose to wait outside for hours. 

Brunch is the name of the game here and the menu is rife with enough delicious sounding options to make your head spin. After perusing many, many reviews and photos here, I went with the Gulf Fish St. Peter, which featured a pan-seared catch of the day (I believe mine was bass) on top of a cheesy grit cake, with a grilled shrimp skewer, sautéed spinach and cherry tomatoes with a delectable hollandaise sauce to blanket it all. It's a beautifully composed dish and elicited quite a bit of order envy from my husband (who went with the 'Skinny Migas' tex mex egg option and enjoyed it very much, but there's really no competing with my dish). We were both blown away by how fresh the fish was and how beautifully everything on the plate came together and regretted that we could not eat more, as the serving sizes are certainly generous here.

The only downside was the wait - which I think could be tremendously improved if seating was organized more efficiently and effectively. For example, we were a party of two, seated at a table for six. And there were plenty of outdoor seats and picnic tables, but those weren't being utilized. 

Overall, a great place I'd recommend for breakfast or brunch.",2018-06-01 12:46:02

I started to walk past the Ruby Slipper but had to stop and see what the menu looked like that held such a crowd. Let me tell you there is plenty of options to choose from! The eggs Benedict and pancakes options really caught my interest. I went to in and was seated right away since I was just a table for 1. I sat at the bar and the bartender was so nice and super friendly. I decided to go with the eggs Benedict mix and match. Unfortunately I didn't take a picture of the menu but I had the two most popular choices and it did not disappoint. I was so full after one that I saved the second one. It was delicious and the cost was only about $15.,2019-12-29 20:54:19

It didn't take long for us to get our food and it came out hot. You know how normal brunches you get a bite size food, no ma'am no sir, you get a lot of bang for your buck.

We put our name in and almost immediately we're greeted outside by a staff member asking if we would like to order a drink. Well yes I do. Coffee was a necessity at this point and it arrived moments later in a blazingly hot fashion. We were seated a few minutes later at the bar. Several staff members checked on us throughout our ordering process and meal. Water and coffee were refilled prior to requesting. I ordered the whites chocolate bread pudding pancakes while my wife ordered the bananas foster pain perdu. Both were fantastic. I requested an insulin shot however they were not accommodating.  Our second trip to the Ruby Slipper was as a group.  Mimosas were ordered and a variety of breakfast food items.  I went with the St Charles breakfast.  It was fabulous. Our experiences were very good.  The only potential drawback for some patrons may be the volume in the restaurant.  It can be loud and would not be good for lots of conversation.,2019-09-14 22:30:37

I ordered the salmon an my boyfriend ordered the Cochon eggs Benedict. He's not as taken in with Benedict's in general but even this dish had him standing on his head with praise. Both entrees had a generous portion of protein. My boyfriend's  plate was covered in pulled pork. You definitely get your money's worth here which is another reason why this place deserves 5 stars. You can pay more for breakfast in NOLA but why when you can have an awesome meal here!

The best French toast I ever had... Was here. Not a huge portion, so you can enjoy your eggs and have room for this deliciousness.

Now onto the food... my boyfriend got the peacemaker. You get to choose two different Benedict's if you can't decide on one. Both the Shrimp Boogaloo and Chicken St. Charles were fresh, savory, and well flavored. The Bananas Foster Pain Perdu hit the spot. If you love banana foster, this is the treat for you.

There was never a doubt that we wou go back to Ruby slippers during this trip because it is THAT GOOD in a sea of other fantastic brunch spots Ruby slipper stands out. Before we were seated I had my self confidence that I would order something different this time, Maybe i felt like it was my civic duty as a person who yelps. But in the and selfishness set in and I found myself back to ordering the same thing as last time. Peacemaker! The house cooked smoked salmon is meaty and tender, with crispy capers, the ideal poached egg and just the right amount of hollandaise sauce. I recall that it is a very rich dish so I would  balance it out with  the fried chicken bennie.  A few dashes of self imposed hot sauce and I was all set. In the end, I wanted to try something else
 but again, I was Not disappointed woth my cave. In-fact, I believe that my over all experience at Ruby Slipper might just make me a better person over all. I left feeling upbeat and more positive about the human race.  It could be the simple things in life- a delicious meal, lively, friendly, diligent service from all the servers especially Brandy or from the friends we made in the rest room and at neighboring tables. My experience was warmth all around in-spite of the snow. (Yes snow) I am grateful.

She didn't ask for a name like she did with the other parties. Ok, no worries, i had enough time until my tour...30mins later I ask her if I can nab the open seat at the bar (I had seen multiple parties being seated at the bar and elsewhere that showed up after me). The hostess says ""there is no open seating- you have to get on the list."" I told her it was just me and you could see the lightbulb click-she had forgotten about me. I get it- they were busy and it happens, but it was frustrating because I now couldn't take my time eating.

I sat in a spot covered in syrup that no one wiped up, so I did it myself. The bartender was very attentive. I ordered the boozy iced coffee (is crack were a breakfast drink, this is it) and they did NOT skimp on the alcohol. I ordered the Peacemaker (Chicken St Charles and Shrink Boogaloo). It took a while to come out, which told me that they were making it fresh and oh myyy was it fresh!! It was so delicious and the portions were generous. While I had to eat and run (with a boozy iced coffee Togo), I wish I had more time to really sit and enjoy it.

My friends got seats at the bar but I had to wait for someone to be finished eating since I met up with them. Unfortunately need to start off by saying the hostess, which I wish I got her name, had a condescending attitude. When I asked her if a seat can be added next to my friends at the bar she looked at me with disdain when I was nothing but polite to her. Very rude. BUT our waitress behind the bar was awesome; great attitude, genuine smile and engaging. Wish I got her name too.

I ordered the Croque Madame-coffee-glazed ham, which I opted out of, with swiss cheese put in between 2 brioche breads which were huuuuuge, and topped with mornay sauce and a fried egg. This dish was larger than life and true essence of brunch lol and it was delicious. I couldn't help myself but drown it with maple syrup. This came with your choice of french fries, creole slaw or fresh fruit which I had the french fries. 

On their yelp page is says there is vegan and vegetarian options. For brunch this isn't so. Almost everything had meat, hence opting out of the ham in my choice. And if there isn't meat it surely isn't vegan. But overall it was a good service. Maybe not the optimal brunch experience but a good breakfast fix.",2018-12-08 14:03:33

Food: 3 stars- Ordered Southern Breakfast (scrambled eggs, bacon extra crisp, biscuit, fried green tomato, and cheese grits) with coffee.  Regular grits came out and cheese placed on eggs (NP for me).  Huge biscuit was so dense it was still a doughy in center.  Fried green tomatoes and extra crispy bacon spot on.  Coffee was fine.

Service:  4 stars- Greeted warmly at door.  Prior to seating, hostess cleaned top before seating.  Seated within 2 minutes.  Servers/bartenders got our drink menu within 1 minute and had our food ordered in another 3 minutes.  So pretty expedient process.  Coffee refilled PDQ.  Both servers were more on the matter of fact side rather than friendly and welcoming.

There will be a line and a wait on a weekend morning around 10:30am.  We waited about a half hour - we passed the time by having a bloody mary at the enormous bar (which I found strange for a breakfast/lunch restaurant).  The bloody was solid - had pickled beans - and a decent kick of horseradish.  I like my bloodies a little spicier, but a little bit of crystal did the trick.

I tried the Louisiana omelette - which has shrimp and cheddar - not fantastic - I hate when I get cheese in an omelette and it has no flavor.  The shrimp were cooked fine, but also not too flavorful.

My second trip, I ordered eggs over easy (Mother's should take a page from the Ruby Slipper recipe book) with chicken sausage.  It was a simple meal but very good.

Coffee was good and bottomless.

Cost was in the $12-15 range - definitely pricier than something like Denny's but several notches above in quality.  Overall, pretty good.",2012-02-27 19:45:38
pHbzQhQ5MeU2ijZjCUWBdQ,jckP4KS3DFeOnsFx8PF5yg,oBNrLz4EDhiscSlbOl8uAw,5,6,5,5,"This spot is a MUST TRY when in nola!!! We came here twice during our trip because it was just that good. Make sure you come to this location at Central Business District because it's more busy so the food is fresher. We ate at the Mid City location for our 2nd time and the bananas foster french toast wasn't as great as the one a this location. So seriously....make the trip here because it's WORTH IT. 

There may be a long wait but that can easily be combatted with the Yelp waitlist! We put ourselves on the waitlist through our phone while we were leaving our airbnb and it takes ~35 minutes to get to the restaurant, so by the time we got there we were seated immediately. Onto the food-

Southern breakfast - AMAZING!!! We went with this one since it seemed like a safe choice and we were mindblown. The highlight of this meal was the biscuit. It's enormous and fluffy on the inside, crispy on the outside. The cinnamon butter that pairs with it is incredible. This was also my first time trying grits and they were so good! 

Bananas foster french toast - there's a reason why this is one of those popular items here...because it's just that great. Hands down the best french toast I've ever had! I was afraid it'd be overly sweet but it wasn't at all. Even though my body was stuffed, it was so easy to keep going and going....we even got this again the 2nd time we went because I couldn't stop thinking about it. 

Chicken St. Charles - fried chicken benedict on a biscuit. Another popular item and definitely a must-order. Not a huge fan of fried chicken or overly greasy foods but this is the one exception I'll make. The chicken is tender and seasoned well, and the batter is crisped to perfection. This dish seriously made me think twice about fried chicken..

Ruby slipper mimosa - Beautiful looking drink...looks like a sunset and holy mother F this drink is STRONG!!! I'm not much of a drinker but I really enjoyed stealing some sips of this from my boyfriend. 

All of the items we had were absolutely incredible that I can't even choose a favorite. I highly recommend ordering any of the menu items here as you clearly cannot go wrong.",2019-03-27 22:03:24

This place is very popular so make sure you join the wait list before strolling through the streets to this establishment, which we did. Hubby ordered The Trifecta- 3 different style Eggs Benedict. One serving each of the Egg Conchon (apple braised pulled pork), Chicken St. Charles (fried chicken) and Shrimp Boogaloo (creole style tomato sauce) Benedict. They were served on freshly baked Buttermilk Biscuits. The eggs were perfectly poached and Aaron loved the entire dish. I ordered the Hot Smoked Salmon Omelette with Goats cheese, topped with dill, hollandaise, red onion and flash fried capers. My meal was absolutely delicious and I will say the small piece of Buttermilk biscuit that I tried was the best I've ever had. It was soft and not dense at all, in saying that I'm not a huge biscuit fan. You can order potatoes or fruit as your side with this dish too. Bloody Mary's and Mimosas are very popular over here when enjoying a Brunch. I order the Ruby Slipper Big Easy Mimosa which has OJ and a dash of Pomegranate added to the champagne. I must say this is the best mimosa I've had yet since moving to the States. They were not wrong when they said easy pour mimosa either! We sat at the bar so I watched them being made. A large wine glass 3/4 full with champagne then topped with juice for $10. Hubby had the Vodka based Bacon infused Bloody Mary which also was amazing! Overall the staff were fabulous, friendly and very accommodating on a usual busy long weekend Brunch morning. The menu has lots of choices and the meals were a fantastic price.

If you have 3 or more people, there most likely will be a wait.  The menu has a lot of choices, their thing is southern breakfasts and creole twists on benedicts.

I ordered the fried chicken benedict. It was ok. The chicken didn't really have any flavor to it.  The eggs were delicious.

The biggest issue that I have with this place is that the service, although friendly enough, is inattentive. Once they take your initial order, good luck getting refills on your coffee or anything for that matter.

My advice to management: you need to retrain your servers to make eye contact with all of their guests and check on them regularly.

For this reason, I probably won't return.",2019-09-15 15:17:47

I went a couple of different times during my recent visit and both times the food was good, the service friendly and the prices are definitely right!!

For lunch I had a simple BLT and some fried green tomatoes, and for breakfast it was an omelet with ham, cheddar cheese and tomatoes.  Both were quite tasty and served by some of the friendliest people who actually remembered me from my earlier visit! (I secretly love that when it happens!)

Both meals cost less than $15 and there was plenty of food and free drink refills on soda, tea and coffee.

But what I really loved about the place was the name.  The owners have a sign on the wall explaining what the ""Ruby slipper "" idea is from.  Hearkening back to the ""Wizard of Oz"" when Dorothy would click her heels together and say, ""There's no place like home"", the name is to honor those who lost their homes in Katrina who only wanted to ""come home"".  Love it!

Go for breakfast or lunch.  There is always a line but they move through the people quickly.  Or know that the bar is first come, first served.  I ate there both days and never had to wait.  And the food comes up quickly so you can be in and out in only 30 minutes if that is what you want.

I like eggs benedicts.  And I like variety.  So of course I had to go with The Peacemaker $15 (Mix & match any two of our Signature Benedicts), since I also have a limited appetite, otherwise I would have seriously considered the Trifecta (featuring 3 different specified benedicts) $20.

For my twosome, I went with:

Eggs Cochon $14
Slow-cooked, apple-braised pork debris served over a buttermilk biscuit, topped with two poached eggs, finished with hollandaise

Chicken St. Charles $14
Fried chicken breast served over a buttermilk biscuit, topped with two poached eggs, finished with a pork tasso cream sauce

I loved their buttermilk biscuit and preferred the chicken over the pork.  The eggs ranged in hardness of the egg white, though both yolks were appropriately runny.

Also be advised that the food does take a little long to come but omg is it worth it! I had the catfish and grits - PHENOMENAL! They also serve the biscuits with this amazing sweet butter so you don't even need to put syrup or jam on your biscuit. I had a Bellini and you'll be happy to know that it was more champagne than anything. 

I tried some of my moms eggs Benedict and it was good but dry compared to my meal.

Cheese grits were amazing, I could've ordered a whole bowl of those.  Crab cake was delicious too. My friend's husband got the Pork Debris Benedict and would not stop talking about it. IT was good, but he mentioned it 2 more times that day, and wanted to go back the next morning just for that.  He even sent some fellow colleagues there for breakfast too.

When I gave the host my name he asked for my # and if we preferred indoor or out, I stated whichever gets me seated quickest. He said okay, we have a system that will text you when your seat is ready. I though okay that's nice smart on their part. The system failed! I got my initial text, and had the option to download Yelp so I could keep tabs on what number I was and how fast the line was moving. I was #38 in line to start. Then i started slowly getting closer. About 45min passed the. I was #8, perfect I'll head to go check in. Mind you i never got a text, I only knew this because I went the extra mile to download the app. I got to check-in and the host told me they already called my name and cancelled my reservation. Excuse Me! So, I showed him my app and how it still said I was #8 and to check in now. He then said oh I'll put you back at the top of the list and you'll be seated next. 4 tables of 2 say down, a table of, and a table of 6. So, was I really put at the top of the list?! I asked the host again. He then spoke to another worker and said we will seat you for the next table of two. Are you sure, can I believe you...another host came out ""Samantha, party of 2. Is outside alright?"" At this point I didnt care anymore sure. We sat. We got a waitress who said it was her first day..she guided me wrong when I was ordering I did not get what she told me. It was still good, but not what I thought I was getting. She didnt check up on us. We got 1 refill of our drinks after chasing her down.

Service was fast, friendly, efficient & sanitary. The bloody mary was fabulous. Water was offered along with drink 2, as food came up. Staff offered to answer any questions and checked in frequently. We were never made to feel rushed & were even advised to take our time, as closing takes a while.

We both ordered bacon-infused bloodies & combos of benedicts - giving us a total of 4 varieties. (Tried changing the picture caption to Trifecta, instead of Trificient, but it wouldn't stick.)

However this high maint tramp with a fake tan, bagged out eyes with her alcohol induced walk of shame looking self, came in and with all the seats available took her overly bathed in purfume nastiness and squeezed in next to us with her sugar daddy.  We left after 5 min of listening to her complain about everything and being a total B to the waitress.  The best part was the waitress snapped back and said...""you can go sit somewhere else or I can take your order""  lolol  The guy was hungry and ordered and the tramp was not happy but we know that not all that glitters is gold...poor thing could not afford to buy her own bfast...so she was trapped.",2012-11-15 21:58:24

Upon entering, I was greeted by friendly staff and an inviting atmosphere.  While it was noon, I was still in a breakfasty sort of mood, so I ordered one of their specialty omelets, with the title of ""three pigs"", as it contained three pork products, with grits, biscuit and coffee.  The omelet was tasty, and large, with the aforementioned pork products being bacon, ham and sausage.  The grits were also fine and of a higher quality than what you can by at most grocery stores.  Plus they were prepared by someone who knows what the proper consistency of grits should be.  The biscuit had the right light and fluffy, but I thought it could have used  little more butter.

My friends each tried a fried chicken egg Benedict and fried green tomato egg Benedict...they all cleaned their plates as well. They also tried a creamy vanilla latte, which looked Uber yummy. The waitress explained that they make their own mixture of cream and milk and vanilla to come up with the creamy part.

Long story:
We come to NOLA several times a year, each time we pass this place there is a line halfway down the block so we make another choice.
Today the line wasn't so long so we got in line for a 30 minute wait, 5 minutes in a guy came out and called us for outside seating although we had asked to be seated indoors, hard pass so after another 30 or so minutes we were called and told to stand inside, mind you there were 3 other people calling folks and seating them while we waited, after about ten minutes of watching other people being seated we stopped a hostess and asked if we were to be seated or not?  In a huff she told us that we were in the staging area and we needed to stand there until the table was cleaned...Soooo another 10 minutes we go to our table . We sat for another 8-10 minutes before our waiter came to take our drink order.  He dropped off the drinks took the food order and vanished..............We sat for 30+ minutes...our waiter then stopped by to tell us that "" every time I pass you I feel like you want your food""  ... ""Your food will be ready in about 19 minutes which is pretty gold for us when we are this crowded""  another. 20 minutes and the waiter brought the food by now My husband was not happy with this and it showed on his face "" the waiter then said"" what's your problem?"" .... ""I feel like you have been mad since you got here!"" So that was the end for my husband he asked to see a manager , spoke briefly with her and we left it was too much the chaos, the loudness, the poor service, we couldn't take any more.

The food was well seasoned and the shrimp and grits had a great flavor but I was jealous of my boyfriends plate after tasting his pulled pork and fried green tomato biscuits! If we ever went back I'd try that.
I highly recommend the margarita! It sounds strong and it is because of the amount of tequila but it's masked well. The mimosas are better than most I've tried but I'm not really a mimosa fan. 

My only complaints are that the stuffed French toast can only be stuffed with whatever the ""stuffing of the day"" is at the time and if you're looking to drink, the drink menu is very limited which was odd to me considering New Orleans is known for their alcohol!",2018-12-23 02:15:03

I'm glad I did. 
This time I went down the eggs benedict side of the menu. 
I went with the shredded pork eggs benedict without hollandaise sauce, you don't need the sauce, it's flavorful enough without it. 
The biscuits they serve with the benedict are nice, large and full of flavor. 
BTW: the regular drip coffee is really good, not too strong or bitter with great flavor.

They have a cocktail server for all those waiting outside the cafe.  She was extremely knowledgeable on the area and their spot! She suggested their Peace Maker to us which allows you to mix & match the Eggs Benedict (what they are known for).  They were amazing!!!  They also were running a promo that sent $1 of every mimosa purchased to Baton Rouge in their efforts of recovery.

Five stars both times! The migas are A+, better than migas I've had in San Antonio. The BBQ shrimp and grits are pretty good--I could drink the sauce by the shot and the grits are perfect, fluffy and silky at the same time (how?! how they got such good grits?! witchcraft probably), but my shrimp were a little rubbery. I tell you this because if you're a square who lets something as innocuous as slightly rubbery shrimp ruin your time, you're not allowed to eat here. I'm sorry, but we don't need you hogging good table room just to be fussy Gus. Go somewhere else and I'll get in all the more quickly because of it. Eat at the bar if you can, because it's fun for people watching and conversation with others. Peach mimosa, ruby slipper mimosa, iced vanilla coffee all good good good. They do NOT rush you out of here on Sunday. We were there for an hour and a half and could've stayed longer. Use the nowait app ahead of time if you don't want to wait, as we waited in the comfort of our hotel before trekking out in the rain and when we arrived, it was only about 15 mins before we were seated (with 15 parties ahead of us, according to the app).

Food: Southern Breakfast, Buttermilk pancakes w/  bacon and a side of breakfast potatoes 

Drinks: OJ and Sweet Tea

Pros: Pancakes - super fluffy and not overly sweet. Biscuit - moist and tasty. Bacon - cooked perfectly and almost taste candied. 

Cons: Waitlist. You add yourself to the waitlist and it gives you a wait time (1-2 hours). Then at the 2nd hour you get a text saying are you sure you want to dine with us, send Yes. Sent yes and 5 mins later I got a text saying sorry you've been removed from the waitlist. It never said you have to check in to be kept on but I guess that's supposed to be insinuated?

Maybe I was suppose to be drunk before I got there. While I found the food pretty heavy it lacked salt, seasoning, and just felt held over from the day before. Hollandaise sauce couldn't even help my eggs or very dry salmon. Bread pudding pancakes smelled great but tasted - ok. Plating is great though because the pictures looked nice.

I had the corned beef Bennie - it was good, a little rich for my taste I think because I got an extra egg because one of the poached eggs had broken.

Food was mediocre at best, service was worse, and after they made us wait an additional hour and finally sat us the front staff barked at us for not having our full party and when I said my sister was changing her baby because her kid couldn't wait an hour, she rolled her eyes at us.

My wife had a double Bellini that was just o.k.  

Her Eggs Cochon, their signature dish, was impressive to look at, but contained too much pulled pork, which basically dominated the flavor of the whole dish.

I really wanted to like this place! I walked by this restaurant a couple days ago. There was a huge line wrapped outside so I thought it would be good and decided to give it a try. They have a couple outdoor benches which was perfect because I had my dog with me. 

The bacon Bloody Mary was a perfect drink to start off my morning. After reviewing picture on Yelp, we decided to get the:

Shrimp and grits - probably my favorite thing I ordered today. Shrimp was cooked well and the sauce complimented the shrimp and grits well. 

Madam Croque - basically a French toast sandwich with ham goodness inside. This too was also great however it was a lot of bread. We dismantled it and poured maple syrup all over the French toast. By the way, the fries were cold when we got it. 

Then we mixed the benedicts
1/2 St. Charles (fried chicken)
1/2 corned beef
It looked great but when I cut into the egg, I saw that the egg was over cooked. After a couple minutes, our server came by and we asked for poached egg. No problem! Instead of taking the dish back, he said he would bring us a side of poached egg. We removed the over cooked eggs with the sauce on it and after waiting for a while, our dish became less appetizing. When the poached eggs came, we asked for extra hollandiase  sauce. He never brought it out even though we waited for like 10 minutes. Our benedicts got cold and dry so we just picked at it. 

Our server a asked us if anyone brought out Hollandaise sauce for us and when we said to forget about it (because it took so long) he already had our check ready in his hand. Boo! Super disappointed in that last dish. Wish it was better service!",2016-11-22 21:29:38

After my husband consumed basically the entire thing, I notice a few finely chopped up bacon bits in the remainder of his pancakes. We were really bummed out as we avoid pork products for religious purposes. This made me nervous as to how pork free my shrimp benedict was.

They have a long menu with everything from breakfast sandwiches to french toast to many different egg benedicts that you can mix and match between, this is kinda their specialty. For my meal I went with the shrimp and grits and since our group was feeling ambitious we also got the bananas fosters french toast to share among the table. The shrimp and grits were pretty good, they had a nice flavorful cajuny sauce with a good amount of shrimp. The biscuit it comes with is huge and dense and almost a meal in itself. The real winner was the french toast though, which was 3 huge pieces of french toast, this is definitely a shareable dish.

The bartender was very friendly and we started with the Ruby Slipper mimosa. It was fine, nothing special. The coffee was typical diner coffee.

When it came time to order, the bartender recommended the bennies. My husband ordered the Chicken St. Charles with a poached egg. It arrived on a massive split buttermilk biscuit with hot, crispy chicken and a perfectly runny egg. He loved his meal and cleaned his plate. I ordered the peacemaker, which is a mix-and-match of two different bennies. One half of my biscuit was the shrimp boogaloo, which was perfect! There were shrimp, fried green tomatoes, sausage, and a sauce heaped onto the biscuit, and I couldn't inhale it fast enough. The other half was the smoked salmon Bennie, which I did not enjoy. The flaked salmon was dry, I didn't get enough capers to cut through all the fattiness, and it wasn't seasoned well. If I had to do it again, I would definitely get a full order of the shrimp boogaloo and leave ten pounds heavier and happier!

We ended our meal with bacon infused Bloody Marys. According to our bartender, the vodka is infused in-house with bacon, and the drink itself is tangy and spicy and just right. There are multiple garnishes, including lemon, pickled dilly bean, and a perfectly crispy slice of bacon. This drink alone is worth coming back for.

The first time I visited I was able to skip the line and sit at the bar (I was on my own). Having perused the menu and pics online for days (I was in NOLA for a week and had planned my food stops carefully), I decided to get the CHICKEN ST. CHARLES for $13 (fried chicken breast served over a buttermilk biscuit topped with two poached eggs, finished with a pork tasso cream sauce). Sadly it looked and sounded better than it was. The biscuit was stale, the chicken was over-breaded and the cream sauce was nothing special. And I could not finish it, and not because I was full, but because I couldn't handle the staleness of the biscuit and the breading on the chicken - and I love fried chicken! The second time I visited (felt I had just come on a bad day the first time), I had the EGGS COCHON for $13, which is one of their signature dishes (slow-cooked, apple-braised pork debris served over an openfaced housemade buttermilk biscuit, topped with two poached eggs, finished with hollandaise). This dish was better than the fried chicken Benny, but the pork was really dry. Good thing I had taken a friend's recommendation and asked for extra hollandaise.

Ruby Slipper Cafe had been recommended to us by several people,and it happened to be 2 doors over from our hotel- perfect! We literally rolled out of bed on a Sunday morning and walked over. We were told there was a 30 minute wait, but that we just had to check Yelp to let us know where we stood in line (so cool!). We just walked back to our hotel room, waited like 5 minutes, and just like that we were notified our table was ready! We walked back over and were seated almost immediately. 

I ordered a hot green tea and my husband went with coffee. We had both read reviews on how good the benedicts were, so we knew we had to go with those. I was super excited to see that you could order ""The Peacemaker"" which allows you to try two different benedicts. I selected the Chicken St. Charles and the Shrimp Boogaloo. Sam went with the Chicken St. Charles and the Eggs Cochon. 

The food came out surprisingly fast! The benedicts looked amazing! I tried the shrimp boogaloo (Gulf shrimp sauteed with pork tasso and creole tomato sauce served over fried green tomatoes, a buttermilk
biscuit and two poached eggs) first and OH MY GOD that creole sauce. The shrimp were so good!!!! And on that biscuit! Ugh! Amazing! I then tried a bite of the Chicken St. Charles (Fried chicken breast served over a buttermilk biscuit, topped with two poached eggs, finished with a pork
tasso cream sauce). This was also very tasty, but not nearly as mind blowing as the shrimp. My only complaint is that the eggs weren't runny. They were basically soft boiled. Runny egg yolk mixing with the sauce and sopped up by the bread is my favorite part of eating eggs benedict. I didn't get that with what we had at Ruby Slipper Cafe. Sam loved his Eggs Cochon (Slow-cooked, apple-braised pork debris served over a
buttermilk biscuit, topped with two poached eggs, finished with hollandaise), and was happy, but not blown away by the Chicken St. Charles. 

Overall it was a good visit. We had very attentive servers and tasty food. I would definitely come back. I would just request that they not cook the eggs as long.",2018-06-27 15:41:08

0mBIIQ3RszDyygGGQBs6Sw,g5_MHfgZyY6PQSQqSE2REA,oBNrLz4EDhiscSlbOl8uAw,5,2,1,2,"Wait/waitlist: it's amazing that you can put your name on the waitlist... I think if they didn't have it, it wouldn't be worth coming here & waiting the entire time. So definitely use the yelp app to add your name on the waitlist!! If you have a party of 6 or less, you have the option to put your name on the list. However, if your party is 7 or more, you have to go see the host and put your name on the list. We came on a Sunday and put our names on the waitlist around 10 am. They said it'd be an hour and a half wait but it was an hour and 45 min wait. There were 64 parties ahead of us (gasp)!! The waitlist is live so you can check on the yelp app how many more parties are ahead of you. If you have 7+ more people in your party, you can try calling them and putting your name on the list or the host told me you can choose 6 people in your party & then in the notes, say the actual amount of people in the party. When you get to the restaurant, checkin with the host and have the host update the correct party size. I wish I knew that beforehand!! We sent our lovely brother in law to hurry there and put our names on the list. So definitely do that so you don't have to waste your time walking there & physically putting your name on the list. Also, make sure to get there a little early so you're there when your table is ready. There were 2 groups that kept getting called & no one was there so they gave the table away. Also, if you're no longer going to go there, take your name off the list! 

Food: we ordered SO many meals... there was 7 of us and we all got one drink & we ordered 9 entrees.. it was almost $250!! Super expensive. However, the food was AMAZING! One of us got the trifecta (3 Benedict's) and the chicken st Charles (fried chicken) Benedict was everyone's favorite Benedict. We also liked the eggs cohon Benedict and stuffed French toast. The BLT was really good. The pancake flight (mix of 3 pancakes) was alright... not that good. Our favorite meal though was the banana foster!!! SO good! Omg. Drooling just thinking about it. It was super sweet though so I suggest getting one to share with the table... it might be a little too sweet as a whole entree for one person. Vegetarian wise, you can order something without meat. I got a Benedict without meat & just added avocado. Boring but it was still good :) Make sure to order ASAP. We ordered around 12-12:30 and the Benedict special was sold out already and one of our guys in our group got the last one!!! So since you're waiting for a long time, I recommend you figure out what you want to eat & order ASAP after sitting down. The food also takes awhile to come out so it's nice to order sooner rather than later. 

Service: I think you might be able to split bills which is nice. The waiters have tablets and they select what each person/chair wants. I hate when you go to a popular restaurant & the staff sucks... not the case here!! Everyone was so friendly!!! The waiters and waitresses work hard & are all so nice. The hostess was so friendly too! I'm sure they get bombarded with people repeatedly checking in/getting updates on the wait, etc but she was so friendly!!! It was such a delight to have such friendly staff! 

Overall, we really liked our meals here. I'd definitely recommend going & putting your name on the waitlist. Do not miss out on coming here!! Especially when the restaurant has a chain of them, you suspect the meals won't be as good... not the case here! Everything was amazing & super filling!!",2018-10-11 20:37:58

We were seated within 10 minutes at 8am on a Friday.  I also put on name on the waitlist through yelp as we were walking over.  Once we were seated, we ordered some coffee.  I got the NOLA iced coffee and my boyfriend got the vanilla iced coffee.  They both lacked much flavor and we ended up only drinking about half.  Our waiter was great and quick.  I can't remember his name.  We ordered the stuffed French toast with a side of bacon and eggs with cheddar cheese and the peacemaker with the chicken benedict and corned beef benedict. 
When our food came, that's when it really went downhill.  My boyfriend's French toast filling tasted sour and looked old.  They also put the strawberries in a bowl on the side instead of on or in the French toast.  the worst part was the side of scrambled eggs.  They brought out a small plate with scrambled eggs and they must've put the shredded cheese on 2 seconds prior to us receiving it.  The cheese was not melted and cold on top of the eggs.  It was gross and we didn't touch it.  The peacemaker wasn't bad, but it didn't live up to the hype.  Needed some more seasoning and better sauce.  Overall, we definitely wouldn't recommend.  We paid our $50 bill and took a lyft over to District Donuts for an amazing fresh breakfast for $20.  I highly recommend that place over Ruby Slipper Café.",2018-11-12 20:44:41

Thanks for reaching out! I'm sure you do, but I didn't mention in my review when I visited... We dined around May 31st, 2018.

My review:

Waltzed in here having no idea what this place was while on a weekend getaway from Texas. Honestly, it reminds me of an Egg & I on steroids, very new Houston diner vibe, not so much like the old Austin diners I'm used to.

Didn't wait more than 10 minutes on a Wednesday morning for a party of two.

Food was on the better side of average, I had shrimp and grits, my partner had an omelette. Everything was going great until she got food poisoning shortly thereafter and we spent the rest of the trip hoping she didn't die. We didn't eat (or drink) anywhere else that day so I really think it was the eggs here that did it.

Giving 3 stars because the food wasnt expensive and didn't kill her!",2019-04-24 22:58:15

The omelet was delicious. The eggs were soft and fluffy. The chorizo wasn't too spicy or overpowering, as it can sometimes be. The pepper jack cheese wasn't too prevalent, but I still got a few peppery tastes here and there. The remaining ingredients -- the red onions, tomatoes and roasted red pepper sauce -- added a hint of sweetness. Overall, it was one of the best omelets I've had in some time.

The potatoes were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and seasoned perfectly. 

But the star of the show may have been the biscuit. It was one the biggest I've ever eaten. It was dense yet fluffy. The honey butter served with it added a sweet glaze to each bite. I easily could have eaten and entire plate of them.

The service was great -- everyone was hustling to handle the large crowd. I highly recommend using Yelp's online waitlist feature so that you don't have to wait outside the restaurant (there is little room to wait inside).

I told him I would have never known if he haddent come out!! I also asked for a glass of chocky milk and was given the whole gallon because apparently I looked like I needed help.

It took 15 minutes to get our drinks (she forgot our order) and over 45 minutes after ordering (an hour after being sat) for us to get our meal and the server didn't seem bothered about it when we asked what was taking so long or why other's received their food first. She commented that it depended on what station we ordered from, but the party of 7 had eggs Benedict selections as well, so we weren't sure what she meant by that. After the long wait, One of our orders was wrong, and it took about 3 minutes for her to replace it with the correct order which made us wonder what the hold up was in the first place. The food wasn't that impressive. My biscuit was hard as a rock and tasted old, and the chicken on my Benedict wasn't as good as other places. A friend's plantain's tasted like cardboard and the specialty Bloody Mary wasn't worth $10.

For being such a popular place (60 min wait via Yelp; another 25 min after ""arrival"" time), I would think they'd have service pretty dialed in. After the long wait, we sat at our table for a good 10 minutes more before being greeted or offered coffee. Our server (nice) arrived and we placed our order right away since we've by now had plenty of time to review the menu. After another 10 minutes, coffee arrives. No cream. Getting someone's attention in this bustling place was near impossible. Another 5 min, after a busboy grabs from another table. Finally a sip of coffee. Order arrives. Request for more coffee. Another 10 minutes. Food is OK, hence 2 stars. 1 order at our table included over-med eggs, they were barely over easy and pretty much ruined that person's meal. When finished, we sat looking at our partially finished plates for the rest of our time, no one ever cleared or checked back in with us. We had to get up and track down our server for the check. You would think for such a long waiting line here, they'd be pretty good at moving tables and getting folks in/out. Not the case, I suppose the reason for long lines. Tourist trap and lots of hype.

This place is just about a couple feet away from the main street, and once you turn the corner it is hard to miss, especially with the large crowd right in front of it.  This was probably my only complaint as the crowd was huge and the wait was long.  There is no actual waiting area so every one is either standing on the sidewalk or just spilling on to the streets, waiting to be called by voice (they need an intercom or a better way to notify).  Once they did call our name, we were sat in the counter area, which nice as it gave an old diner feel.  Our order were taken with no problems

I had ordered the Banana Fosters Pain Perdu, which was very delicious and not overly sweet.  My girlfriend decided to be slightly healthier and order the Catfish Coubion, which was refreshingly tasty.  Both dishes were hefty in sized leaving us stuffed!

When we got there, the wait was twenty minutes. This wasn't a problem so we crossed the street to wait in the sun, like so many other patrons. More diners came after us and, after twenty minutes of waiting, we went to make sure we hadn't missed our name. ""One more table ahead of you,"" we were told. 

So we moseyed back over and resumed waiting. Then, a couple who had arrived after us got called. Since they were two and we were three, we assumed we would be next. Over the next fifteen minutes, however, we saw at least 4 groups of three and a group of six, all of whom arrived after we did, get called in to eat. 

Befuddled, we headed back into the busy restaurant to see what was happening. We were first ignored for a solid five minutes before anyone even looked at us. When we finally were spoken to, we were frustrated and we may have expressed that in our tones. We will admit that. However, instead of being apologetic, the host was curt and abrasive, putting his hand up and shrilly exclaiming, ""give me a minute!"" Seriously, dude?

After he and the other host talked quietly for a minute, the host said ""it will be another minute."" We were over it, so we left. Why should we want to give our money to a place where we have to throw a fit to get served? The food may have been good, but we'll never know.

When I arrived at 7am there was a line to get in but I found seating right away.

Service
Eating alone, I sat at the bar in the middle of the restaurant. The service was friendly and attentive. Some wait staff were at the end of the bar putting cocktail garnishes together and chatting. They all seemed happy; one was even eating breakfast. It's a good sign when the staff eat their own food.

When I was cashing out the waitress asked me if I wanted a coffee to go.  Hooray! What a great offer!

Food
I was going to order pancakes but the waitress pointed out I can get those anywhere and suggested one of their specialties. I chose their housemade corned beef hash and eggs.  The portions were large and tasty. The chunks of beef and potatoes were just right and very flavorful.  The horseradish sauce was perfect - not too spicy for the morning, but full of flavor that went very well with the beef and potatoes.  I wanted more! The coffee was great - not the typical diner fare that tastes cheap and like cardboard.

Overall I would definitely recommend this place and definitely return.",2014-09-21 00:29:18

It's the kind of place where you bring your friends and family because you know you're getting quality.

We sat at the bar, which was bustling with activity along with the rest of the (understandably) crowded restaurant. Our waitress was nice and made great drinks! 
My Peach Bellini Mimosa tasted like it was made with real peaches. After our first night in NOLA drinking a bunch of horrible sugary drinks like hurricanes this refreshing fruity drink was a godsend. My bf's ""19th hole"" cocktail which is basically an Arnold Palmer + vodka, was tasty but STRONG! 

As for food, I had the BBQ shrimp and grits and bf got the 
mixed eggs benedict plate with the shrimp boogaloo and eggs cochon bennies. Honestly, ever since our breakfast here I have been unwilling to order shrimp and grits anywhere else because I know they won't compare. The dish was actually quite simple but the flavor of the seasoning, the meatiness of the shrimp, and the perfect creaminess of the grits was unparalleled. And they didn't have to add globs of cheese to give it flavor. The bennies were amazing too! He preferred the shrimp but I have never tasted such tender, flavorful pork before. 

I liked that they gave us the bill as soon as we put our order in because it explains why they're relatively fast here and don't have ridiculous lines.

Pro tip : make a reservation on Yelp if you're plan to go during peak hours or you just might get yourself a free hydrating sauna tan standing in the line outside. We did just that and waited for about 5 minutes after arriving before being seated.

After a few ""not so great meals"" in order to avoid the long lines/waits, we decided to go ahead and wait in line for The Ruby Slipper, and we are glad we did. 

Drinks: since we had 30-40min to kill we decided to treat ourselves to a mimosa and bloody marry... Even though it was 9:45am. These were not amateur beverages. We were served 16oz of strong ""time to wake up"" drinks, which we were feeling 1/2 way though sipping them.

Service: fun, friendly, and sociable staff. They were great. 

Food: with so many delicious looking things on the menu, and amazing looking food coming out of the kitchen, it was hard to choose what to eat. After much deliberation, and a suggestion from our server, I went with the Breakfast Sandwich. 
It. Was. Amazing. One of the best I've had! This scrumptious sammy had two fried eggs, pepper-jack cheese, outrageously good pig-candy bacon,and a fried green tomato sandwiched between a housemade buttermilk biscuit.

With three New Orleans locations plus restaurants in Pensacola Florida and Orange Beach Alabama, The Ruby Slipper Café promises diners a worthwhile breakfast, brunch or lunch of Southern Staples reinvented, the popular Magazine Street location proving decent, if not memorable, in a city with no lack of great alternatives available.

Attached to The Pelham Hotel, though not affiliated in any perceivable way aside from sharing a restroom, The Ruby Slipper Café is a family owned and operated restaurant known mostly for its encouragement of day drinking and hearty plates of comfort food intended to accompany it, the ever bustling space often featuring waits of up to an hour on weekends, though the 'nowait' app has recently given diners the ability to check-in online and spend their wait checking out downtown New Orleans shops or looking for parking spaces.

Seated at the center of a room completely packed at 9am on a Tuesday, the father & daughter pair to our right a stark contrast to a quartet of Seahawks fans sporting a two-day hangover just a few tables to the left, it was with greetings from a friendly server that orders were placed for three plates, one side and two coffees, the roast from French Truck smooth and lightly floral but nearly impossible to have refilled without repeated requests.

Turning away incomplete parties, though happy to let singles or those waiting for others belly up to the bar, it was after perhaps twenty minutes of chatting and listening to music play over the din that plates arrived from the kitchen, a quick look at the Pancakes immediately raising suspicion that someone had ordered poorly, doughy bites not dissimilar from Bisquick not seeing the minimal amount of Cream Cheese Frosting or Artificial Maple Syrup do the item any favors.

We had breakfast here 3 days in a row during our stay as it was right across the street and it was DELISH.  I tried to taste everything!!!!! The first day I was not happy when the server would not take a togo order at the end of the meal.  He said that I had to go over to the bar and place it.  After spending almost $200 on our family meal that day needless to say I was a little bit upset, but I kept it moving.  We were not going to hold up the table but just wanted to place the order.    Freddie on the other hand, we got him day 2.  He was GREAT! Very accommodating and took my togo order right from the table. My adult special needs child struggles with large group settings so we needed to take her food back to the resort.  Freddie apologize about the prior day and took care of my family.

The sweet vanilla cold coffee is refreshing and not overly sweet. This is a great brunch option in the Quarter for vegetarians as they don't focus on the typical New Orleans seafood here.

The wait time Thursday wasn't bad (or used the online waitlist feature) but Saturday it was about 45 minutes, which is to be expected on a weekend. Staff is friendly and welcoming... better service on Thursday then on Saturday, but again they were busy Saturday so NBD.

Thursday I have the eggs Benedict with pork debris, and it was delicious! Not nearly as heavy as you would expect... The business very light and there was just the right amount of rich, salty pork. The hollandaise almost tasted like cheddar, but it was really good. The coffee drinks are a little underwhelming... The vanilla iced coffee was pretty weak and the spicy vanilla coffee was covered in canned whipped cream, but their regular old coffee is pretty good and definitely better than the fancier ones IMHO. 

And my second trip back I had the bananas Foster French toast, and I was not impressed... I think my expectations were too high because of what I had read online, but the bread was tough, there weren't very much bananas, and it was REALLY sweet (more sweet than flavorful). I couldn't finish it. Again, I don't know if that's because it was the weekend and they were slammed, but I think you could find better bananas Foster French toast in the city where it's famous.

The food itself was a disappointment, partly maybe because the room temperature thing didn't help with the taste and texture. I had the egg cochon which was their signature dish.

I love their mimosas; they are heavenly and I don't know what they do to them, but they are delicious and don't taste like any other mimosa I've had (in the best way possible).

For my meal I enjoyed the Eggs Blackstone, which is Eggs Benedict on a biscuit and tomato. It's good, but I wasn't crazy about the hollandaise sauce. Maybe it's just made differently in the Northeast. 

This is a pretty casual joint that attracts both tourists and locals. Despite how busy they are, the tables are turned quickly and the service is top notch. I've heard that people have waited to get in and I've seen the line on a Sunday afternoon while I was walking around, but I was lucky enough to not experience that during my visits.

First off - I was able to skip the large line being by myself. I ordered a cup of coffee (ok, diner level) and the eggs cochon. Sounded like a winner - poached eggs over pulled pork on a biscuit covered in hollandaise. 

What I got was a mess. First thing I noticed was one egg was a weird shape - turns out their over poached it so much it was like a bouncy superball. The other egg was also over poached but still edible. 

The pulled pork was good! Part of it anyway, half of it was stone cold like it came out of a cold case. The other side was luke warm. Almost like they ran out of warm pork and grabbed some from a fridge to top it off.

The biscuit was alright. And the hollandaise was put on extremely sparingly. 

To top it off it was comically underseasoned. I probably poured a 1/4 teaspoon of salt on it.

That should be the motto for Ruby Slipper Cafe.

A recommendation from my good friend Gina P. from Yelp Fort Lauderdale that Ruby Slippers Cafe is the BEST breakfast place in the French Quarter, but beware of long lines!!!  She was right on both fronts!!!

Regarding the line,  my wife and I had learned once we got to the hostess stand which is just right in the doorway for the restaurant with a lovely, patient hostess, that you can either put your name in at the door or use the Yelp App to put your name in and track where you are in line to be seated.  We put our name in with the hostess and used the Yelp App to track where we were in line to get seated.

As we were waiting I had a chance to look inside.  Plenty of seating, but quite the busy place. A large U shaped breakfast bar in the middle, surrounded by 2 top tables on the left and a larger dining room to the right of the bar with 4 top tables and booths. There is also outdoor seating in the front and side of the restaurant. 

After looking at the menu, and seeing the great breakfast dishes all around me, I can definitely see what all the hype is all about. People were PATIENTLY waiting outside like this was ""the attraction"". And it certainly was.

When our name was called, we thankfully got seated a the breakfast bar which I preferred.  There is a lot to see sitting there and recommend it if you can wait for that.  We were greeted by our vibrant and friendly server, Nicole C. (she never gave us her last name) when I asked.  We immediately knew she was from the midwest and had some fun with that when talking to her.

Coffee Anyone?  Here, like many places in New Orleans, they have the BEST coffee.  We had to have the NOLA roasted coffee which was served in the special Ruby Slippers red Coffee Mugs.  Delicious.

Just looking at the Specials for the day posted on the Specials Board,  which included Spiced Pumpkin Pancakes and Nutella & Raspberry French Toast and looking at the menu, this was going to be a tough choice.  The choices of 7 different ""Eggs Traodianary"" Eggs Benedict dishes and ""Momma can't make this"" Specialties alone had my head spinning.  At least my wife was with me so we could both order something different and share.  

It was no surprise that she ordered the Spiced Pumpkin Pancakes. There was no doubt that I was going to choose one of the Benedict dishes, but I was torn between Chicken St. Charles and the Eggs Cochin. Of course, Ruby Slippers had a dish called THE PEACEMAKER, which definitely gave me a piece of mind to be able to get combo of both dishes. The Chicken St. Charles is one of the most popular dishes here; Fried Chicken breast over a buttermilk biscuit topped with 2 poached eggs and a delicious sauce to top it off.  The chicken was a tender chicken breast, definitely fried Southern Style.  Juicy and tender and that Buttermilk Biscuit, well, let's just say, you would remember it after leaving here. The reason for the Eggs Cochin?  I love pulled pork, and to have that on top of the buttermilk biscuit served Benedict style with Hollandaise put me in Heaven. Between the 2 of these, I was in ""food mode"", for sure. 

My wife's portion of Spiced Pumpkin Pancakes was HUGE, thankfully, topped with a powdered sugar and some special sauce drizzled on top. Amazing amazing, amazing.  I could smell the Pumpkin as soon as Nicole put it down in front of us. 

The menu choices on the Momma Specials can also make your head spin, but as I learned from a gentleman sitting beside me, they have a dish called the Trifecta which allows you to combine 3 of he dishes.  Clever for a menu like this to offer that. Every dish is better than the next and to be able to try 2 of the Benedict dishes or 3 of the Specials is a smart option.

For every minute you wait, it is worth every bite you take here.  The atmosphere is lively with a lot of happy diners.  Nicole C. made our experience special and there is no doubt that a whole lot of love was put into the menu and food preparation.  

ABSOLUTELY the place to go when I come to NOLA, and will again and again. After all, there I a whole lot more to try here.",2018-10-28 14:41:31

I could see a crowd outside the location from my hotel and it was pretty much there throughout the morning. Perks of being on yelp though are that you can check into the line before getting to the restaurant. We came here on a Sunday morning and the total wait time was about an hour for 5 of us but we only spent about 20 minutes waiting at the restaurant since we checked in at our hotel. There was a server outside though taking drink orders if you wanted something while you wait.

Our server was amazing- I wish I remembered his name to compliment him. He was super energetic and able to provide helpful suggestions for menu favorites. Definitely one of the best servers I've ever had- he really just seemed like he loved his job which makes the dining experience that much better. 

I am always hesitant to try new things so I had a cheese omelette with breakfast potatoes and a biscuit. The food was good and actually really enjoyed the potatoes and homemade biscuits but I tried some of my mom's ""Trifecta"" and it was AMAZING! So much flavor and I instantly regretted not trying something new. You get to try one of each: Eggs Cochon, Chicken St. Charles & Shrimp Boogaloo Benedicts. I still am not sure which of the 3 was my favorite- they each were so flavorful. The chicken wasn't too greasy, the pulled pork had a great flavor and juicy, and the shrimp reminded me of a typical meal that would be found in NOLA.

Ended up ordering the Shrimp Boogaloo Benny. MAN! The flavors in this were unreal! I am certain I've only eaten fried green tomatoes here in NOLA and I am now highly addicted. The creole tomato sauce that was generously smothered over the poached eggs and jumbo gulf shrimp was so tasty!

Very helpful in explaining questions we had about unfamiliar items on the menu. Gave great suggestions on improving the taste of menu items with the different sauce choices. Perfectly succinct in checking in on us in passing while dining. The food was excellent. The beignets starter was excellent. Goes great with the saucer of praline sauce. I had the French toast bites that were the perfect blend of crunchy outside/soft inside. Great location just around the corner from Canal Street. The online waitlist is a great way to check in and walk the block on canal street til they text you when the table is ready. Excellent place for brunch. Couldn't have been a better place to end our visit giving us a reason to make the trip back again soon.

I understand that Covid is a big inconvenience to a lot of businesses and restaurants but at the same time restaurants are responsible to accommodate their guest accordingly their whole entire waiting system needs to be upgraded desperately. The food was OK but my overall experience was horrible. I'm only giving it a 2 star to be polite.

The first time I ordered the shrimp and grits and because I was feeling greedy, I also ordered one cobbler pancake that I shared. Those by far were the BEST shrimp and grits I've had in my life and I've had my fair share of shrimp and grits. I didn't get as much of the BBQ taste as named in the meal description but I did get a tasty and strong rosemary flavor. I could've eaten the meal on my own. It was that good!!! The pancake wasn't your average pancake either. It was just delicious! I originally thought the blueberries were cooked into the batter but it was actually topped. Originally I was disappointed but that disappointment was quickly eliminated once I tasted that pancake!! It was amazing! To wash it all down, I ordered the peach Bellini which was huuuuge and had a nice surprise of diced peaches at the end of the drink. 

Needless to say when I returned, I ordered the same thing. One word of advice is to use the help app to reserve your seat because the wait is pretty long if you don't. The app allows you make a reservation and it tells u what time to be there.",2017-07-27 06:05:41

Thirty to forty minutes is nothing when you get to enjoy a fabulous pomegranate infused mimosa at the bar. 

Moving on to the food, I have nothing but praise to give. Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day and the culinary genre I enjoy the most. Their dishes were such a fun, and sensational twist on the average eggs Benedict or French toast. Skipping the menu entirely I choose their special of the day- poached eggs over French bread, fresh spinach, seasoned artichoke hearts and plump champagne cherub tomatoes. The sauce was a red pepper purée and while that sounded spectacular enough to a Texas girl visiting the Big Easy, I'm a sucker for hollandaise and the heart wants what it wants! Not wanting to miss ANYTHING I ordered both sauces and was in heaven. I actually thought to myself whether the looks I'd potentially receive would be worth licking the plate clean- it was that good! My friends had the classic scrambled egg breakfast with homemade buttermilk biscuits. They were in love with the red pepper purée and found themselves adding it to everything- roasted red potatoes, eggs, sausage...

The pros: 
A server offers you drinks while you wait outside that can be paid for with cash. You can check in online and cut your wait time down significantly. Their menu has something for everyone, and the plating was great. The biscuits = excellent.

Order your mimosa with juice/puree on the side to get a healthy pour, otherwise its 50/50.

The cons: 
It took 30+ minutes to get our food, which was a catfish benedict, a smoked salmon benedict, and a side of fried green tomatoes. The salmon had the same texture as canned cat food. If we weren't as hungry as we were, or knew we could get a replacement quicker, we would have sent it back. My gf is Jewish and eats lox/nova once or twice a month, and I grill/blacken/pan-sear fresh salmon at least 3x a month. Sadly, we both agreed it was unanimously the most disgusting salmon we've ever eaten.

There was a definite shortage of holl sauce. A biscuit as tasty and as large as a cinnabon needs some lubrication going down. We would have liked more sauce. 

Our side of fried green tomatoes were served with cold sour cream. I would suggest a cajun queso served hot, or a warm roumelade. Definitely ditch the sour cream.

For $15 & $17, neither one of our bennies included a side of ten cent grits, hash browns, home fries, or fresh fruit, which were extra. In visiting a dozen states in the past 4 years, I don't think I recall seeing bennies not include at least half of an orange wheel on the plate to balance the savory.",2019-05-20 19:53:16

Sunday was our final day and the ones left in town decided to have brunch at the Ruby Slipper. We arrived around 12:30pm and expected a wait. The hostess took my number and informed that I would receive a text once our table was ready. About 30 minutes later, not a bad wait at all, I was texted and we were seated in a booth. Our server was lovely and informed us that they are known for having a good bloody mary. Well, then, no need to persuade me any further, bring over that award winning bloody mary sir! I love being in Nawlins for bloody mary's because they usually add either a shrimp, a crawfish or something pickled such as okra or green beans to the drink. Additionally, the tomato base is always on point!! I was NOT disappointed. My linesisters ordered the peach bellini. They weren't that fond of their drinks and thought it to be syrupy. I tasted it and... it tasted like.. a bellini LOL. They changed to a mimosa instead and were satisfied. I order the gulf fish dish. It came over a grit cake with a hollaindaise cream as well. It was good but not the explosion of flavors that I am used to receiving in NOLA. My line sister ordered a side of a grit cake but was given cheese grits instead. Somehow something got lost in translation during the ordering and the server informed us that they don't provide the grit cakes a la carte. Whatttttt? Oh my, if I can make one suggestion, add the grit cake to the a la carte menu or offer as a side.

It was a busy Sunday afternoon so service was slow but actually a lil slower than I would have liked but hey, I had my bloody mary. I'll visit again for sure and will try something else. I enjoy working my way through a menu. Until next time... Laissez les bon temps rouler!",2016-12-04 20:18:01

We were well taken care of by Annmarie at the bar and she definitely made our experience more enjoyable! 
We started with some tasty breakfast cocktails and then some French toast bites. Deelish! The cream cheese drizzle was divine! 
I had the Chicken St. Charles, think eggs benedict with a Southern twist. Fried chicken on top of a buttery open biscuit with a creamy sauce and poached egg on top! Sweet, savory and delectable!
The breakfast sandwich also received high marks. Look forward to our next visit!",2021-07-20 23:25:00

I think because of the chaos they aren't totally able to give as much attention to the food to make sure it is hot for instance. 

About the chaos:
People were literally waiting for 2 hours and more to get in. There is not a ton of seating, so they can't really accommodate a lot of people, which definitely added to the chaos. Do not just show up, or you will be one of those people waiting for 2 hours. You need to join the waitlist ahead of time, so when you arrive to check in, you can be seated within a few minutes. If you do not join the waitlist before you arrive, everyone who joined the waitlist will continue to leapfrog you.
Fortunately, I joined the waitlist ahead of time, but did witness some angry folks who did not join the waitlist and were upset that others were seated before them because they didn't understand the process. I think the hostesses could have yelled out a few times to the crowd to encourage them to join the waitlist or explain the process some more.

You may be turned away by the long line- don't be!

You may be turned away by being 50th on the wait list- don't be!

You may be turned off when you look inside and see how small the place is - don't be!

Folks this place is the real deal. My wife and I spent 4 days I. The area this week and she wanted me to try this place, her advocacy was on point! We had breakfast here 3 days in a row, why go anywhere else! Fortunately we were at the Sheraton, so right out the back door and we're at the restaurant. We'd jump on the waitlist, sit in our room until we were close to being called, then head on over. Their estimation on you being seated is pretty close to accurate everyone. 

What's good?
The service. The folks aren't over the top, but friendly and cordial. Think about it, they have a waitlist from open to close, so to be on that whole time is a lot to ask, but they're all good to me. 

The food- shrimp and grits are heavenly, Benedict's are really good and offer a ton of variety, corned beef hash- incredible, and the pancakes variety and taste was truly awesome. I'm a Starbucks snob and the coffee is even good here.

A few of the staff were busting their bottoms to give excellent service, the rest were too chatty and it too more than 15 mins to get our drink ordered and 25 mins for our order to be taken. The appetizers came out relatively quick. However we had to literally flag down our waitress twice and she still forgot to bring our order until I stated loudly, ""we are going to leave, forget the food and bring us our bill."" It took the other wait staff to hear and get the food brought out.

Once we got the food, of the 4 entrees we ordered, one was edible and the other three were under seasoned and over cooked. We paid and left. The rest of the day we all had the worse stomach pain. Keep in mind, this was our first meal of the day.

I just wanted a little bit of food so I ordered the shrimp remoulade over fried green tomatoes with a side of cheese grits.  The tomatoes were in a good, flavorful breading, and fried nicely; not greasy at all.  Next to them was a little bed of mixed greens, and then the chilled shrimp remoulade.  If I were plating this, I would have put that over the tomatoes (especially since that's the menu description.)  Instead, it was off to the side and there was barely any sauce to it - I don't know, it just seemed plopped there and I would have liked enough sauce to actually dip more than one bite of the tomatoes in.  The shrimp also had an off texture, even accounting for the fact that it had been refrigerated.  The grits were standard mediocre diner fare, gloppy, and with just a sprinkle of shredded cheese.  They also committed the cardinal sin: no salt.

So I got my bill to put an end to all this, and thought I would just pay it and leave.  But wait, what's this?  Ummmmm, $2.00 plus $8.00 plus 98 cents tax equals a total of $10.98, yet the amount due is $11.00 even?  This doen't add up, literally.  The young waiter's explanation?  The computer does this sometimes randomly on people's bills?  Adds a cent or two?  Uh, no, I'm pretty sure you can't just do that.  I'm pretty sure that I've never seen that done anywhere else, and that if your establishment is well aware of this, then you should probably fix that - unless you're doing it intentionally.  I know it seems silly over just a couple of pennies, but if they do that to enough people, it can add up.

So that's my fault. But, the food wasn't hot and the chicken didn't seem freshly cooked. It was just so-so in the flavor department, and the gravy that should've been on top was a no-show.

I actually DID use Yelp...and typed shrimp and Grits into the Yelp search menu. I then browsed pics of which places grits looked the best. As Andrew Zimern would say, ""if it looks good... eat it!""
Browsing images of this place, I saw the shrimp and grits in that sculpted do-hickie bowl along with buttermilk biscuit. But it actually looked too Foo foo-e for me.  

However having worked in the hotel til noon, I looked up at clock, Holy Guacamole! Famished I redid the ""shrimp and grits"" search and the Ruby Slipper showed up closest walking distance. Yep that's my lazy ass scientific search criteria. It wasn't til I was done eating that I bothered to read my fellow elites reviews; raving about the place. 

When I arrived walking down Magazine St,  I thought there was a street party as folks were hanging out with bloody Mary's in plastic cups and a strip of bacon as the swizzle stick. I Bogarted my way up to the front and a gorgeous young lady all 4'9"" of her asked if I wanted to sit at the bar. I was ok doing that. Then she started talking and I couldn't understand so I leaned down and she got mock mad at me for implying she was short and I couldn't hear her way up in 6 foot land. Short Stuff lead me to the bar and literally in 2 minutes I was seated. In another minute I had hot coffee and water and my order of shrimp and grits on its way. 

I then proceeded to search for ""Dubs"" tickets on line since they are playing the Hornets 2-nite (sorry ya'll, I can't bring myself to call them the P-bird word).

The bar is a great place to hang, catch up, make new friends, and score some hella good seats for a fraction of Oracle prices to see the Dubs!!! The waiter delivering my plate saw the section I was purchasing and said ""Score.. great seats"".

The shrimp plump and well seasoned the grits were no big thang except I like the rosemary they used to  season them. I'm totally steeling that idea! It's not like the grits were bad, they were perfectly cooked but pa-leeze when do you ever rave about toast or mashed potatoes? Only when they suck! Well these grits did not suck. 
The biscuit was as big as an 8 month pregnant hockey puck but cutting into it was light, flakey and moist as a cloud. Great with some buttah and Honey. 

The coffee was awesome; had two there, and my waiter hooked me up with a fresh cup to go. 

The meal was uneventful except some dude in a Chiquita Banana outfit apparently delivered a banana-gram to someone in the restaurant. Also Short stuff stopped over to inform me two ladies wanted to speak to me. I told her to tell them I was her squeeze and to back off. That got a big hug from her. 

Feeling stuffed and accomplished that I scored Dubs tickets and likely saved $500-1000 smackers, I headed out coffee in hand and managed to get another big hug from short stuff on the way out as well. I assume that was the signal to whomever those ladies were to back off jack!",2017-10-20 19:35:37

We got greeted by a cute lady working outside getting people drinks while they waited. My boyfriend got the traditional Bloody Mary, and I got the Irish coffee with two shots of Baileys Instead of one baileys and one whiskey. Super yummy and mild!

We were greeted by Sandy who was very sweet. We ordered the peacemaker with one fried chicken Benedict and one pork Benedict. Both were great but we both agreed the pork was better! Followed that with the bananas foster friends toast (I don't remember the name of the actual dish) which was surprisingly not as sweet as it looks.

THE TRIFECTA: Perfect dish to get a taste of Ruby Slipper. I liked Eggs Cochon, Chicken St. Charles, and Shrimp Boogaloo in that order. I enjoyed eggs cochon, which was pork debris, almost like a braised pulled pork over a buttermilk biscuit and topped with poached eggs and hollandaise. The Chicken St. Charles was an exquisite fried chicken topped with a decadent cream sauce. Even though I am not a big fan of fried chicken, it was crispy and still moist. The shrimp boogaloo was also good with big gulf shrimp over a fried green tomato and creole tomato sauce. My only complaints were the bottom of the buttermilk biscuits were very hard and my poached eggs were a tad bit overcooked that the yolks were hard, not runny. 

CORNED BEEF: A underrated dish at Ruby Slippers - corned beef hash served over a buttermilk biscuit, topped with two poached eggs, horseradish cream, finished with hollandaise. My SO favorite diner dish is corned beef hash and this did not disappoint. His eggs were perfectly cooked and biscuits were flaky and soft. Highly recommend!

Before you come here I strongly advise that you join the yelp waitlist. I ordered the peacemaker (corned beef and Cochon), someone else I was with got the pancakes and lastly someone else got the BYOO. Both of my eggs Benedict's were delicious and I was pleasantly surprised to find potatoes underneath my corned beef Benedict. The pancakes and omelette were great as well. My only complaints about this place is that the BYOO isn't worth the money you pay for it, being that you will literally have to extra pay for everything inside the omelette. Next thing you know and you've spent 18+ dollars on an omelette that was originally priced at $11. My only other complaint is that the food took longer than I expected it to take at least 20-30 mins, but hey it's New Orleans and it was busy.",2019-06-18 13:20:24

Especially after a 30 minute wait and an even longer wait for food to come out. SO long.

It reminded me of our own The Flying Biscuit local chain, but, not as good. Moreso because of the various locations and popularity with visitors.

With all of the reviews and awards, I was expecting to be blown a way at least a little bit.

I went with the shrimp and grits. And Imma pause real quick for the sadness of those grits.

THEE absolute blandest, most disappointing grits I've ever put in my mouth. No salt at all. if it wasn't for the bit of reduction that it came with, there wouldn't be much flavor. Shrimp were small and few. I was more upset about waiting well over an hour to consume that.

But the few times I have, have been like a dream. The waitlist should come as no surprise and no wait is too long for a taste of Ruby Slipper's incredible Bananas Foster French Toast--a creation of buttery rum sauce poured over a bouquet of crusty baguette and rum-flambéed banana slices--dotted with plump rum-soaked raisins and covered with a light, snowy dusting of powdered sugar. To add to the magic, Ruby places a crisp slice of applewood-smoked bacon atop of this sugar-butter mountain. 

I knew we would need a little more savory to help balance all the sweet, but nothing, not even the melt-in-your-mouth biscuits served with a side of maple butter and the pig candy--a slightly sugared piece of bacon--and the crispy breakfast potatoes that just burst with flavor as you bite down on them, none of these could come close to touching the greatness of that French toast. I am definitely a savory breakfast person. The last flavor in my mouth has to have some salt, but no matter how many times I tried to end on a salty note, I kept going back for another forkful of that Bananas Foster. 

Since last weekend, I've woken up every day craving that flavor that I can't seem to find anywhere else. Oh, other places have variations on that theme and they're all good, but they aren't haunting. When a restaurant is able to create a feeling of being ""haunted,"" that's when it manages to make followers out of people and I am now a follower for life.

Classic Buttermilk Pancakes with Bacon

Eggs Cochon - Slow-Cooked, Apple-Braised Pork Debris served over a Buttermilk Biscuit, Topped with Two Poached Eggs & Finished with Hollandaise

Shrimp Boogaloo Benedict - Gulf Shrimp Sauteed with Pork Tasso and Creole Tomato Sauce served over Fried Green Tomatoes, Buttermilk Biscuit, & Two Poached Eggs

I go to my trusty Yelp app and make a reservation although we were only 500 feet away from the restaurant.  We were greeted by the host that got my reservation and had a table ready for us.

We got the banana foster french toast and the two eggs benefit of the Chicken St Charles and the Shrimp Cortez. And a side of eggs. The Food was amazing. I loved it so much. Who would've thought fried chicken would be good with a poached egg. I absolutely loved it! The shrimp one was amazing too. The sauce on that one was better. However, all of this was INCREDIBLY salty. By the end of it I couldn't take it anymore and actually left some behind which isn't a good sign. 
The eggs were scrambled perfectly. I devoured them. I wasn't a huge fan of the Banana foster french toast because it was drenched in some honey syrup sauce or something and it made it sooo soggy. I like my french toast crisp. But it was interesting. 
The mimosas were pretty good. Nothing out of this world but you have to get the ruby slipper. It's what they're named after! Super strong so that was a plus.

I had the Biscuits & Gravy. You could tell the biscuits were homemade. They had a good flavor as well as they were thick. I could have used a little more gravy but I made it work. My mom had the Chicken & French Toast Bites. She let me try them. The French Toast Bites tasted like a hybrid of French Toast and cornbread. It was an interesting taste. The chicken was ok. It tasted good where the spicy sauce was but where it wasn't, the chicken was a little bland. I tasted a bit of one of the omelettes and it was good!

There were a lot of people waiting, but we were able to get a table in less than 5 minutes. The waiter that attended us was extremely sincere and swift to getting us everything that we needed.

I had the Corned Beef Hash Benine Benedict and my girlfriend had the Cochon. It would be a lie if I said this wasn't the best Benedict I ever had. Everything from the runny egg, to the soft English muffin and the beef was all full of flavor and tasty.

The whole decoration that the Ruby Slipper had and all the quotes creates the perfect formula for beginning your day the right way.  

What I enjoyed the best may be silly, but it was the coffee. I'm a huge coffee person and I like my coffee black with no additives. The coffee had an indistinct taste that made every sip warm and fulfilling.

Next time I visit NOLA, I will make sure to return to the Ruby Slipper and enjoy the amazing food and service.",2017-07-10 20:44:12
US-HzWNTiJ7y6CI2Mf3D2Q,-oXwLkQppNwwRX9j2vPTTA,oBNrLz4EDhiscSlbOl8uAw,4,0,0,0,"Amazing brunch spot. We came during a weekday and it was still busy, which was insane to me. The hosts ask for your number though, so no need to stand in line and it's a nice street to walk down in the meantime. The indoor seating is definitely more spaced out than in previous pictures, but it still feels a little cramped, so we decided to eat outside. The reason for my four stars was mostly because of the service. I've worked in similar brunch spots like this and what really makes the experience, in addition to food and ambiance, is service. Maybe our waiter was having a bad day, but you gotta put that past you when you serve a table and he didn't do that, so that's disappointing. Everything came out great, but just his attitude and lax demeanor made it a little less enjoyable. 

Regardless, food was overall good. The beignets were a little disappointingly small, but still good. My friend enjoyed the burger, but said it was a little dry (he doesn't eat pork, so he didn't get the bacon though, which we were told makes the dish, so make sure to have bacon in yours when you order this). The sliders were amazing and to be honest, I don't remember their names because I got four different ones. The best ones though were the chicken and gravy biscuit sandwich and the eggs Benedict with corned beef. Good entrees to make up for the service and disappointing beignets, but that's what makes it four stars. Wholesome southern spot nonetheless.",2021-03-18 15:29:19

The waitlist option on Yelp was nice to have but it did not make a huge difference when it came to our wait time since after we checked in, we still had to wait for another 20 mins or so. 

After reading some reviews and reccomendations I had an idea of what I would order. The pictures were also helpful. Once seated, the waiter informed us that they are known for their Benedicts. Although I am not a runny egg, Benedict person I really liked the way the St. Charles option looked. I asked if I could have my eggs over hard and a non pork hollandaise sauce. Once I was was told it was doable, I was all set with my order.

My fried chicken was well flavored, my egg was not runny, my bisquit was nice and flaky and non doughy plus my side of corned beef hash was a nice compliment.  I will say, they skimped on the corned beef hash because it was more of a garnish on the baked potatoes that it came with rather than a true side on its own.

My sister had the Combo Pancake option: 1 Cinnamon Swirl  and 1 White Chocolate Bread Pudding,  they were really rich and delicious. I know this may not resonate with a lot of people but as a child I enjoyed going to McDonalds for breakfast on the weekends.  I can still remember the taste of those well balanced, buttery, and fluffy buttermilk pancakes. Strange enough, these Ruby Slipper pancakes brought back those childhood memories and I loved it.

We had a 35 minute wait around noon, but that gave me time to check out the menu. Trust me, I used every minute to figure out what I was going to eat since everything sounded amazing!

So, this place is super cute! We had a nice server who told us the Mardi Gras specials (can also be found online because I didn't see a feature menu). I started with the French vanilla iced coffee. Ummmm it was delish!! I always worry when something says it has vanilla syrup, but that was yum!

I finally decided on an entree cause I kept changing my mind. I ordered the Migas and my dad ordered the Chicken St. Charles. The migas...what a tasty breakfast scramble! Just stir in that chipotle sauce and go to town! I could've ate the whole thing but I had to make myself not. I got a side of grits, too, and I was dipping the scramble in it. Mmmm mm!

The chicken Benedict my dad got was also tasty! I appreciate a proper poached egg- which this had. The chicken was crisp! I probably would've added some hot sauce to it for an extra kick. 

I wanted to try so much. My recommendation is if you're with a group, just all order something different and share. So much yummy goodness to share. I truly wanted to try it all.

One additional thing -- 
My wife ordered the Bananas Foster Pan Perdue and it was soooooo syrupy my wife couldn't eat it. Which was not the worst thing -- it was that once the bartender saw my wife didn't like her breakfast -- it was a complete vanishing act. 
Then when we asked for the check another server flicked it toward us and walked away. 
My meal was great but yeah tough to enjoy things when you get mistreated like that.

My friend ordered the eggs cochon and I got to try some. The pork was surprisingly dry, I thought it could have used some sauce to jazz things up. Maybe the yolk from the poached egg was supposed to serve this function but the eggs on both of our dishes were overcooked and not even a little runny.

I ordered the Peacemaker Benedicts. I LOVE this idea, you choose two of their eggs benedict dishes, because who likes to make choices? I chose the chicken saint charles and the shrimp boogaloo. The chicken was perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, flavorful all around. While it did come with a drizzle of tasso cream sauce, between the big biscuit and the overcooked egg the dish didn't really come together.

But the boogaloo was perfect! Shrimp and tasso over fried green tomatoes with a tomato based sauce. Even with the overcooked egg the dish was moist and delicious. I would definitely get this again.

Bacon infused vodka bloody mary's are money. They are potent so don't get carried away ...save some room for breakfast.

The biscuits are buttery and flaky just as a good biscuit should be.  We got the St Charles(eggs Benedict with fried chicken), but I was jealous of our friend who got the Trifecta - one of each eggs Benedict including one with shrimp. I was salivating while looking at his plate - while throughly enjoying mine. Chicken was perfectly breaded and still juicy. The combination of flavors and textures was on point.

It didn't disappoint! People asked about cost as the US fiat worthless dollar keeps getting more worthless each day! Depends on what you get! Expect to pay about about $18 per person sans the tip! Only had one drink - coffee which was excellent!
Service was excellent also! 
So why the four stars? The menus on Yelp were sorely outdated as disappointing so were the hard menus at the restaurant.
Wholesale costs seem to go up each week as these restaurants have to keep adjusting their prices.
The menu also is a tad confusing.
I guess I misread it but it showed build you own omelette and then pick three items for $1!!! Stupid me! They charge a $1 for each item! Poorly written! Misleading at best!
As to the food! The omelette was good and hot! Came with an outrageous biscuit and sugar cane butter which was to die for!
My partner ordered The Peacemaker - a combination of two eggs benedict of your choice! She said they were good! One was a crawfish and the other was a pull pork on a half of biscuit! All items appeared to be made to order and not steam table ready except the breakfast potatoes.

I loved the atmosphere, it is very open and vibrant. I also loved their story of returning home after the hurricane, which parallels the story of Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz.

We ordered the eggs benedict and banana foster french toast. I loved that you can choose 2 different kinds of eggs benedict for your order. I absolutely LOVED their banana foster french toast, drenched in the caramel syrup, stopped with bananas and raisins.

The hour wait didn't bother me. The hostess told me how long it would be, I chose to put my name in, I expected to wait. We got our text that our table was ready, we walked up to the hostess stand and we were promptly seated at the bar. I LOVE sitting at the bar. I love the energy of a bar, the activity and he people watching. We had just seen in a local magazine that the Ruby Slipper was voted best breakfast in New Orleans so super excited. I understand restaurants are understaffed, I understand where there are challenges, I am experiencing them in my business. As a restaurant owner, I tend to actually be much more tolerant and give the benefit of the doubt. We get out coffee, there are two bartenders working, a man and a woman. Coffee is hot, bar is great, we place our order. We ordered the trifecta (love the ability to try a variety), sausage, bacon, grits, home fries and a build your own omelet. Awesome, excited! See a couple across from us who order at the same time and a man across from us who orders shortly after. Order on our receipt went in at 10:38. Ok, cool, coffee, conversation, great energy in the restaurant. Fast forward 15/20 minutes, couple across from us who ordered at the same time get their food. Awesome, ours should be soon. Guy across from us gets his food. Um, he ordered after us, ok, ours should be coming. At 11:05 I ask how much longer. I know they are busy, I also know that people who ordered at the same time as us and after have gotten their food. Guy across from us ordered the same thing I got so it's not like it was a longer ticket time item. The bartender comes back and says we are the second order on the screen. I ask when the guy across from me ordered, turns out three minutes after me. The couple who ordered when I ordered is finishing up and getting their bill. Now I'm irked. Another 8 minutes. Now, this is where I'm really not happy with the service. Not once did the servers acknowledge that it was taking a while, nothing like ""hey, I'm sorry, that's super frustrating that you see food coming out and it's not yours"", not "" let me go grab my manager this really is taking a long time"". The female bartender avoided us once I asked where the food was. No one went to a manager to say hey, go check on these guests. No manager was required, but the bartender didn't even acknowledge the near 40 minute wait for food. The food was served, my food had been sitting under a heat lamp, plate was hot, top of the benedicts were hot, poached eggs were not hot. The omelette was not hot inside, the potatoes had no crisp and what looked like a beautifully presented meal was disappointing. The food was ""fine"" but nothing exceptional and certainly not worth the time or money. I realize there are thousands of amazing reviews and mine isn't like the other reviews but, an empathetic acknowledgment or a table touch by a manager could have turned this around. Obviously being voted the best breakfast doesn't happen with experiences like this and my little review isn't going to make it break their business but, I'm sorry to say I was disappointed in the lack of attention to service. I know a kitchen manages a huge part of a meal but the service was less than lack luster and it didn't have to be. I'd like to give 1.5 stars but it's not an option.

Three.

It was 8am and the place was already getting pretty busy, so I was afraid I was going to end up waiting over an hour for what I needed to be a quick meal. I was promptly seated at the bar by the host staff where the bartender, Kristy, took my drink order and made me feel incredibly welcomed with her down to earth style and friendly and sincere attitude. She offered up a few suggestions before I ultimately settled on the migas. Even though the restaurant was pretty busy, she and Lewis made sure to keep me sufficiently caffeinated and paid as much care and attention to my little party of 1 as they did larger groups (a rare find in my experience dining alone). My migas arrived hot and fresh within 15 minutes of placing my order. Very delicious and very reasonably priced considering the locale, however I will be returning for the exceptional customer service and experiential value rather than for rAnhen-fazbi7-kobhidthe food itself.

4 stars because I know they can do better, but today was just not it. Our waitress was new so I give her grace for that because she came off a bit rude but it may have been because she's learning. My friend ordered eggs Benedict and it was COLD. You can not eat a poached egg cold. We had it remade and it still came back lukewarm. I got the shrimp and grits, the portion is SIGNIFICANTLY smaller than it used to be, about 1/2 the size. And honestly wasn't as good, 3 star worthy. The French toast bites were amazing though, 5 stars. 

Lastly, PLEASE DO NOT ORDER THE SEASONAL MIMOSA FLIGHT. They need to take it off the menu, none of them were good. None. I can not emphasize this enough. All terrible.

I ordered Migas aka scrambled eggs, chorizo mixed with pico de gallo and chipotle ranch and chips. Let me tell you, this was the best things on the table! Unfortunately my french toast was rather hard and not something i could easily get down with maple syrup, this could have been so great but its way too hard for me personally.

The bacon was good, but average compared to a diner and my Mimosa was sour or had spoiled orange juice contained in it, which made me tell the waiter to have it removed from the bill. I got regular OJ instead. Just a waste tbh, I could've made that better at the crib.

Since i Came during July 4th weekend, and I didn't try the other menu options here, I can't totally right it off. The crowd was diverse and the waiters were attentive for it being busy as it was, but the noise level killed my train of thought ha. Place is way too loud and food not memorable enough for me, to pass up another option for breakfast on my next trip.

eQJac_MRmK5UfrVeEXjMvw,ATteiNcdLaYYs19BDususg,oBNrLz4EDhiscSlbOl8uAw,4,1,1,1,"My first impression of Ruby Slipper was not good because the hostess at the sign in table outside the door had her head down on the podium like she was ready to take nap and was nowhere near welcoming at all. There was no smile, no ""hello"" or ""welcome to Ruby Slipper"" which sucked. She was also less than encouraging about the 15-20 minute wait that I thought was pretty minimal but from the look on her face and the ""Debbie Downer"" tone of her voice you'd if thought she was the one having to wait in line!!!

The rest of the staff were quite friendly, smiling and welcoming. We were seated at the bar/counter which I typically don't care for but it was spacious and fun. Our drink and entree order was taken timely and came out within 15 minutes.

I ordered an Irish Coffee w whiskey & whipped crenels which was excellent and heavy on the whiskey, so much so that I had to ask for a little more coffee to mellow it out, lol. I also tried the Bacon Bloody Mary (I had too! It looked so good and I love bloody Mary's). I was disappointed though because it was lacking the flavor and spice I look forward to. (There are much better Bloody Mary's in town - I will not order it again).

The dishes were ordered were the Cochon  Benedict and the Migas egg scramble. At first glance the dishes looked very incomplete and scarce,especially the Benedict - it just seemed like it was missing a side of fruit or something which would have made the plate more appealing. My husband said the Benedict was just okay (not great by any stretch) - the biscuit was dry and the pulled pork wasn't as flavorful as the menu suggested. The poached egg and the hollandaise were good and prepared well, but he won't order this dish again.

I loved the Migas scramble and will order it again & again! It was fluffy, spicy and full of flavor. I especially liked the sour cream sauce it came with. I wish it would've had at least half an avocado instead of the two small slivers and maybe some toast. In hindsight, I should have ordered toast or a pancake with it to make it complete. It was still delicious and very filling.

I recommend checking this place out. The food and customer service (in doors, lol) are worth it.",2016-02-01 10:31:03

I came here on the Friday after Thanksgiving.  It was quite sunny despite all the ""black"" Friday references I kept hearing... My companion mentioned, as we walked down Magazine St., that they have a reputation for long wait times.  Luckily our wait was quite short.  Maybe 10 minutes.  Granted we were there around 9am.  There were many more people waiting when we left.  

The interior was eclectic with lots of local art (for sale) on the walls.  Counter seating in the middle and many tables.  We commented several times about how happy all the staff seemed to be as well as how friendly they were to us and everyone around.  +1.  Despite being incredibly busy, our server was attentive and ready for action.  +1.  It seemed loud, and we talked about how that was a good thing to us b/c it meant we could talk and cut up without fearing rebuke from our neighbors.  +1.  (my dad said that the other locations are even louder and uncomfortable to him)  We ordered bloody's and they came out fast and were quite spicy.  I like to be able to see though my bloody, but my friend said hers was just right.  +1.  The menu wasn't too big but there were several things I wanted to try...so I guess I'll go back.  +1.  

My breakfast cohort ordered the smoked salmon...benedict?  I tried to look it up for this review but couldn't find the menu on their website.  She was a little let down that it wasn't the thin sliced smoked salmon like you would get on bagels and lox, and because it was on a bed of spinach leaves that soaked up all the hollandaise, but said the flavor was good. -1?  I also had a benedict.  Poached egg, hollandaise, tomato and bacon on top of a biscuit.  I noticed that all of their ""bennys"" were on biscuit and not muffin, which I would prefer, but I still cleaned my plate.  Hand cut hash browns were hot and crispy.  +1

Doing the math, I'll give this location on this day 5 stars.  The next time I spend the night in the quarters I will come here (early to avoid lines) to try something different.  Thanks.",2014-12-01 22:14:24

After a terrible hotel breakfast, we decided to head out and try RS based on generally strong reviews and were very happy with it.

It's not a huge place, and it's very popular so be prepared to wait. Since we visited on a Tuesday AM our wait wasn't long. The menu is full of delightful sounding things which made it very hard to choose - ultimately I settled on a corned beef hash benedict.

CORNED BEEF HASH BENEDICT. On a BISCUIT. Holy Christ, it was the biggest biscuit I've ever seen! Each half was about 6"" in diameter and an inch or more thick. That's just crazy, especially when topped with homemade corned beef hash, poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. The flavors were just right. 

Our server was nice and attentive and our food arrived quickly. A few teeny tiny nitpicks - I wish my food would have been warmer and that the corned beef hash was more corned beef and less hash. That aside, my breakfast was amazing - I only ate half and 10 hours later I'm still not hungry. (Also, if you're a wee bit hungover, this dish will set you straight. I'm not saying it from personal experience or anything but....)",2014-02-05 00:18:43

Order
Grilled fish St Peter $15 - fish of the day (Drum fish) over a cheesy grit cake, topped with sautéed spinach & tomatoes, a skewer of grilled shrimp, finished with creole mustard hollandaise.

Side order
Pig-candy bacon $3.50


My food took 30 min but the service was so good and the waitress kept me informed of the progress.  It didn't seem like it took that long.

My food arrived and what a site it was to see that glorious plate of deliciousness!

It was plated just perfectly!  There were 2 large triangular shaped items that looked like they were baked.  That was the cheese grits cakes.  They were fantastic.

Sticking out of a grit cake was a skewer of grilled shrimp.  They tasted so wonderful I could have eaten more.

The Drum fish was cooked perfectly and tasted great.  I loved the creole mustard hollandaise. It was drizzled over everything on the plate.  Yummy!

The pig-candy bacon came with 2 slices of perfectly cooked bacon covered in a heavenly coat of sugar candy goodness.  You need to get a side of this it's that good.

My visit was perfect from the cheerful greeting at the host stand to the server who provided excellent service.

So I left the hotel to explore until I get the ""we're ready to eat"" call. I get the call...to go to the Ruby Slipper Cafe. And well, just damn...

First, let's talk about efficiency... I meet my party in line OUTSIDE and they're ordering drinks. (Someone is taking a play from the Chick Fila playbook. Kudos.) I had the Peach Bellini. Strong enough to get you tipsy but not enough to lay you out. PERFECT. 

We're seated fairly quickly. COVID-19 protocols were in place and you can scan the menu. I opted for French Toast bites, lightly drizzled in a creamy icing and with syrup, as a starter. 

I ordered the Southern Breakfast--two eggs, bacon, biscuit, fried green tomato, and Grits. Food is well cooked. Bacon could have been a little thicker quality, but it was still good. Eggs were fluffy. Fried green tomato was seasoned and fried well but small. You only get one, which is fine, but two would have been nice. 

NOW...y'all, let me tell you about these GRITS. I have NEVER in my entire 46 years of life had grits that didn't need something. I little butter, a little salt, a little pepper...you get the point. I had already asked the waitress to bring extra butter. 

But these grits right here...y'all, these grits needed absolutely NOTHING. Had my waitress come back to ask, I would have ordered more. Like enough to take back to Mississippi more and tell others of this deliciousness nestled in the French Quarter.

Verdict. I'm trying to get back over there before I leave New Orleans.

EAT HERE.",2021-05-30 23:38:55

When I went I had a 90 minute wait - doable for me because I could wait in my room.  When I got there I was seated at the bar - the bartender was extremely flustered and kept taking orders ahead of me particularly at the take out window (it makes zero sense to make the bartender service the bar and the take out window but they do it). After about 20 minutes he finally took my order - I had the Bacon Bites appetizer, migas, and the bacon infused Bloody Mary.  The Bacon and the Bloody were top shelf - totally worth the wait and BS involved.  However, the migas were meh. Migas is my second favorite breakfast food next to only biscuits and gravy - I've had migas all over Texas so I feel like I have a pretty good frame of reference for what makes the dish well prepared.  Here the eggs were generally fine - maybe a little cool when they arrived - but the real disappointment was the tortilla strips which seemed to be either stale or soggy. Anyone who like migas knows that the tortilla really makes the dish otherwise it's just a chorizo and eggs scramble. Any way these migas were maybe a 5/10.  The bacon really saved this visit for me.  I'll also add - this is definitely a brunch spot - do not come here if you are looking for quiet because it is always packed.",2021-06-01 17:42:38

We arrived on a Sunday morning around 7:45.  The restaurant was already packed but we were able to be seated right away.   

Our waitress was attentive and friendly.   She answered all our questions and gave suggestions.  I had the special which was shrimp and poached eggs with cortez sauce.  My husband had the shrimp abd grits.  We also ordered the banana foster French toast. 

All the dishes were delicious with good flavor.   The shrimp was small but not overcooked and the cortez sauce was not too rich.  The sauce had a little spicy kick.  The French toast was not too sweet and bread was not soggy.
The shrimp & grits was rich.  The flavor was good, but I am lactose intolerant so the cheese was too much for me (which was okay since it was my husband's dish).

I also had ice coffee and my husband had the vanilla ice coffee which were both good and not watered down. 

Bill total was around  $57 not including the $15 tip.

Our server recommended any of the egg benedicts which seems to be a staple at this place. I ordered the Peacemaker with the Shrimp Boogaloo & Hot Smoked Salmon. I didn't read the menu correctly but this was definitely grilled salmon instead of the raw smoked salmon that I was hoping for. The biscuits for both were kinda hard to me but everything else wasn't bad. I also go tthe white chocolate bread pudding pancakes...which was the best dish there. I normally don't like sweets but everything in my body was telling me to order this and I was so glad that I did because I loved every minute of it!

Let me explain.  We came here based on the amazing reviews, and stopped by for brunch.  New Orleans has some of the most amazing food, and so we figured this would be a fantastic place to continue our food extravaganza!

We ordered the Green Fried Tomatoes... and let's just say, if this was the last food on earth I'd get to eat, I wouldn't complain.  They were delicious.  So was the - french truck coffee which is code for - here's how good coffee can actually taste!  We sat at the bar, and the service was great - until I got my Breakfast Tacos which were super bland... as I was dissecting my order trying to match the ingredients list (which sounded delicious) to what was actually in the taco and trying to figure out where this whole thing went off track straight into bland town... I realized it was missing the sourcream, and cheese... so what I ended up with was a rather watery, eggy, boring tasting mess...here's where Jarod comes in.  Without me saying a word, and honestly, I would have kept my mouth shut, he could tell something was off, and quickly realized with a glance that it wasn't done correctly.  Without my prompting, or talking him out of it, he took care of it immediately and got me the correct plate...

...This would have been a 1 star review - 2 if I was feeling generous, because despite the coffee, and the amazing fried green tomatoes... this is a big miss.  But Jarod saved it.  Kindly, with empathy, a smile, and without any hassle... if I as running a business, and had nothing but Jarod's working for me... it would be called SPACE X and it would be taking us to mars as we speak... so here's to Jarod, I hope he gets appreciation, kind words, maybe even a hug, and a raise!",2021-11-01 21:53:21

We ordered the pancakes which were average and luke warm. We also ordered the salmon eggs Benedict - the food was cold and we had to send it back. The waiter at first spoke back when we said it was cold rather than simply apologizing (and continued to provide poor service throughout the meal). When the food did arrive after, the flavors were overpowering and it was not in a hollandaise sauce as stated. The eggs were overcooked rather than poached properly. We even had bad stomachs after the meal (and I can now see another reviewer on yelp who had the same experience). Additionally the restaurant was very cold as they left the door wide open when it was very cold outside and everyone had their coats on, so the ambience wasn't comfortable. Giving two stars is actually generous and mainly based on a different waiter being nice. We wouldn't return here or recommend to others. There is much better food out there",2022-01-05 14:10:55

Eggs benedicts galooooore. They have a combo with three bennys, but between my boyfriend and I, we thought it was too much. So instead, we opted for the combo with our choice of two eggs bennys - we chose the chicken and the salmon. I was a little disappointed the salmon was the cooked kind (it was dry), but the chicken was super juicy!! The bread that the put it on is not dry also, so it went super well with the toppings. We also ordered the Ruby Slipper Salad, which I'm guessing is their signature salad. It was the perfect complement to the bennys, although the salad had a bit too much vinaigrette for my liking.

There is an option to order and pay for drinks while you wait. Anyways, we waited for maybe 45mins to and hour. Sounds like a lot of time but once you start ordering drinks, the time seems to fly by. Lol! 

There is both indoor and and a quaint outside seating area. Indoors appears to be spacious, however with so many people inside it doesn't appear that way. We were seated at the bar. Our server, can't remember his name, was very nice and attentive. 

We ordered the fried green tomatoes as an appetizer. We'd never had green tomatoes so we had no clue of what was in store. Boy were they good! And the chipotle like sauce thats on it... made it even more delicious. Small appetizer but very filling and tasty.

For my main dish, I ordered the Migas with crawfish. Highly recommended by the server and now highly recommended by me. It's an omelet with crawfish (obviously), diced tomatoes, and shredded cheese served over tortilla chips w/ an avocado on the side. DEE-LISH-US!

Came highly recommended and they weren't wrong! We came here on our last day in the city. Immediately, the outer appearance of the Broad St. location was odd... it looks like a government office building from that side... but that's the way our directions gave us. If you come in from the other side of the corner, that's the way in. Cute little cafe with bright colors and chalk-written signs with fun sayings about food, drinks, and brunch. A hipster's dream, but we found out they have the goods to back it up. 
We ordered 2 bloody mary's and an Irish coffee... my Irish coffee was good, but the 2 bloody mary's looked totally different- one was very strong and almost clear, while the second was much thicker and darker with much more mix. Wish I took a side-by-side photo because it was so obviously inconsistent to serve to the same table at the same time. That being said, this was the one and only mishap of the entire meal. 

We ordered the special crawfish benedict and the Eggs Cochon benedict. Both were amazing! The crawfish version was served on a grits cake and the cochon was piled high on a buttermilk biscuit. They could've used HALF the pork on the cochon- at the end, I had enough meat on my plate still to make an entire second order and I had eaten A LOT of pork already. The biscuit was buttery and the sauce was delicious and tangy. My friends raved about the Crawfish Benedict being the best thing they ate the entire trip... and we tried many different places over the week!

They also have a bunch of really cute logo swag, all made with quality fabric that makes you want to wear it. We bought a couple of shirts to commemorate our awesome meal, even though they were kinda pricey ($26 for a t-shirt and $40 for a long sleeve with a hood).

I had the Sausage Gravy Benedict, with the eggs on the side and scrambled instead of on top. The biscuits were good as was the gravy, but they seemed under cooked.

We had to follow through on our return visit. Why eat here twice when we were swimming food options, some without an hour wait? Because it really is THAT good! Our 1st AND last stop.

You can add yourself to the waitlist right here, after reading this review, unless everyone else does too & crashes the system. 
There's a server making rounds ouside for drink orders, while you wait. We ordered bacon bloodies & vanilla spice lattes. We had our text for a table before finishing the coffee. 

We sampled food and drinks at more places than I will remember. What I will remember is that the absolute best bloody mary we had was right here.
The bennies are phenomenal but, today we opted to try something else: cinnamon swirl pancakes for the hubs - whoa, huge and delicious. They were well balanced and super tender. I went with the shrimp omelette and they did not skimp on the shrimp. Mine was paired with grits & a gigantic biscuit with their take on butter. Neither of us were able to finish, though we both took several ""just one more bite"" opportunities after the forks were down. I would still recommend starting with bennies- ideally the peacemaker, where you choose 2 kinds on one plate. (VS the standard 2 on 1 kind on a straight order.) My husband, on the other hand, says you hafta try the pancakes. So, my solution, take a friend and share!

The real kicker for me was when the gent next to us very apologetically ordered a special order: salmos avocado toast, no salmon, no egg, no cheese, add shrooms. There pause no response was met with an enthusiastic ""yeah, we can do that - whatever you need!"" That is great service!",2020-03-10 16:50:00

It's obvious that this place has a ton of business knowing that as soon as I walked in, practically every table was filled! The place has sort of a classic feel, you have your bar, booths, and numerous tables made out of old wood. Sort of nostalgic if you ask me. Anyways, lets get onto the actual review.

Chicken St. Charles (4.5/5)

There's always something so satisfying about eggs when it comes to breakfast, lunch, or dinner. The fact that it adds consistency in flavor and texture is the reason why this was the perfect combination with the fried, crispy chicken breast placed on top of a warm buttery biscuit. I always save the yolk for last, and tend to eat around it until there's only the last bit of food left. So, as I placed my fork into the egg white and got a small bite of the chicken, biscuit, and egg together, my mind was definitely blown. I guess you could say I had got so used to seeing ""Shrimp & Grits"" on every menu, this was refreshing for me. The chicken was perfectly seasoned and the biscuit was soft, crispy and golden. Once I got down to the last piece of the Chicken St. Charles, the yolk was still sitting on top of the piece of chicken which I carefully placed my fork into. The yolk ran over the chicken and piece of biscuit just like a waterfall in Hawaii. 

That one bite was heaven. It was it. Paradise. Cue mic drop. 

Banana's Foster Pain Perdu (4/5)

Nothing really too different from your regular Banana's foster. The french toast was moist, and the distribution of the sauce was perfect. I liked the fact that they used fresh slices of banana on top of the french toast, other then that, not too mind blowing.

In conclusion, the experience was nice, but I certainly think that the one thing which separates the Ruby Slipper from any other breakfast place is their signature benedicts. So, if you do decide to go there, don't pass them up!",2016-05-26 21:36:14

DON'T STOP DRINKING -- The bacon-infused vodka bloody Mary is my favorite drink ever. They are generous with the bacon, and the pickled green beans are sublime. I still dream of that drink. All bloody Mary's dull in comparison. AFTER you've had a bloody Mary, continue your day drinking with the peach bellini mimosa, morning margarita, and the boozy iced coffee.

BRUNCH IS LOVE -- I'm an eggs benedict fan, and kudos to the kitchen staff for nailing their poached eggs every time. I HIGHLY recommend: 

1) the Chicken St. Charles -- delicious, crispy fried chicken, topped with a perfect poached egg and a pork cream sauce of goodness. 

2) the Eggs Cochon -- they call it apple-braised ""pork debris,"" which didn't' sound appetizing to me, but I guess it's just a ton of small but delicious pork pieces mounded on a buttermilk biscuit, topped with a poached egg and traditional hollandaise.

3) The Peacemaker for the indecisive -- if you can't choose between the two recommendations above, get one of each! They have plenty other bennies to choose from, so mix and match to your heart's content.

If you're too hung over to go with a creamy sauce, get some pancakes to soak up all the alcohol in your system -- the Pancake Flight will give you a sampling of all the delicious flapjacks they make, but if you have a sweet tooth, I recommend the Cinnamon Swirl Pancakes. Add the pure maple syrup for $1.50 more and thank me later. 

I also found the Southern Breakfast to be a good hang-over meal. Eggs to order, stone-ground grits, the most divine bacon, biscuit, and fried green tomato. Because, healthy choices.",2018-12-19 16:28:29

Great morning cocktail selection and a menu that will paralyze you with the inability to choose from so many tantalizing choices. Jazz was a great server and even in spite of the fact of the place getting slammed made sure we got attentive and cheerful service. Bridge was also an awesome hostess who extended enthusiastic New Orleans affection on all of her guests. The food was delicious. The French toast bites were sinful to start off with. I had a breakfast sandwich with every ingredient prepared to perfection. But that leads me to my only quibble-the sandwich came on a plain white hamburger bun.

I heard a lot about the Ruby Slipper and the line is always down the block. So, hey, let's give it a go! 

Use the No Wait app to get a good head start on the line. That was a plus for this experience. The staff is super friendly and full of smiles, love and ""baby's"". The hospitality that is Nola. 

We ordered the Peacemaker -  Shrimp Boogaloo and St Charles Chicken and a side of Fried Green Tomatoes.   They were both lacking flavor.  There were maybe two shrimp on the shrimp dish. The biscuits were awesome though!  The salsa used on the shrimp dish was good and helped the dish along. If you order this, order an additional side of sauce.   However the sauce used on the chicken was bland also. It wasn't memorable. 

I love the atmosphere here and the story behind the restaurant. It's packed all the time and they've won best brunch many years in a row, so there must be many more elevated taste buds than mine out there.

All of the food was great and I even had a breakfast margarita! I was having a difficult time choosing an Eggs Benedict when I noticed the Peacemaker. You could get one each of two different benedicts, so I couldn't pass that up.

I ordered two things (yes I'm greedy): the crispy chicken filet and the seasonal stuffed French toast. The crispy chicken filet (served with shoestring fries) was definitely crispy, but it was a bit underseasoned. I thought I wouldn't like the citrus coleslaw but that and the mayo definitely helped to add flavor to it. The seasonal stuffed French toast was bomb! It was too large slices of French toast bread with the filling in the middle like a sandwich. Also, this came with bacon which was cooked perfectly.

The worst thing about this place was the speediness of the service. Because we waited so long, everyone knew what they wanted to eat. It took just about another hour for us to get our food.

For such an excellent place, they lose a star because they are really great at the specials, but they often leave the day-to-day meals, particularly in sides like potatoes, to people who don't exercise the same care and attention to details. Keep someone over that skillet making the skillet potatoes, and don't leave them until they are dry and dead.  You also don't want anyone humming the Blues Brothers ""Rubber Biscuit"" when you serve yours, and unfortunately, I was going all Dan Ackroyd after trying one.

If you stick to the specials you won't be disappointed. I had a catfish with polenta cakes that was beyond excellent, and a Bloody Mary that was tasty and inventive. They have other nifty specialty drinks that dress up brunch, and roll back 5 o'clock to 9am in the N'Awlins style 7 days a week.

Service was excellent. The wait wasn't too bad during Jazz Fest, about 30-40 minutes, although I hear that doesn't change.

ap5ldr894_PnShBV6BAoaw,sf5Qq2Y0lF5LEMunI9eqUA,oBNrLz4EDhiscSlbOl8uAw,1,4,1,1,"This was the worst dining experience I've ever had in New Orleans; and my family is from New Orleans so I've been there more times than I can count. 

We used the no wait app and arrived at the suggested time and had to wait an additional hour to be seated. The only seating available after an hour wait was outside (we made it work, after asking to be moved from sitting very close to the dumpster.) 

Our server Nicole was not attentive at all. My mom waited 45 mins for her drink. We had to ask for napkins, to go boxes, straws, refills, condiments, and more several times.  

EVERYONE's food was cold or room temperature. We decided to just deal with it. My aunt's pancakes were so undercooked that you could see the dough once you cut into them. She asked for a new (warmer) plate and the Nicole brought out a new plate literally 2 minutes later. So it was obviously not made for my aunt because how would they have fixed the plate so quickly? SURPRISE SURPRISE ... that food was cold too! 

We spoke to the manager about the cold food...his response? Sitting outside is what caused the food to drop in temp. At this point, we are all scratching our heads. Number one...it's JULY...sitting outside should not cause my food to be cold. Number two...I am from Texas where outside seating is the norm and I'd never had this problem before. Number 3...I couldn't believe a manager was telling me the reason our entire tables food was cold was because our waiter had to bring it to one of their outside tables. A simple apology would have sufficed. 

I've heard people say this place is great. Maybe we picked a bad day. But I was highly disappointed. I travel a lot, and you can check my reviews. I'm not one to just leave bad reviews for the heck of it. But this experience was so bad...I said at the beginning that this was my worst experience in New Orleans...I take that back...this was one of my worst dining experiences in my 25 years of existence.",2018-07-16 04:21:40

I had been planning on stopping here on our trip to New Orleans because my friends had been raving about it. We checked into the waitlist on yelp but still had to wait for awhile when we got to restaurant, which is okay. This place is very popular so if you are going at a high traffic time you should plan on a bit of a wait. One thing I really liked is that you could purchase a drink or alcoholic beverage to enjoy while you were waiting. When we finally got seated at the bar we ordered drinks and food. We got our drinks and waited for our food. And we waited, and waited, and waited. After almost 30 minutes the bar tender noticed our food still hadn't come out and went to check on it. Which is not the bar tenders fault whatsoever, but of course we're hungry so we're getting a bit impatient. Finally when our food came out, the shrimp in my fiancée's shrimp and grits were definitely undercooked. But at that point we'd be there so long we were just over it so he ate what he could instead of sending it back and ate part of my meal that definitely was more noteworthy than his food.

Came here for Sunday brunch, and there was a long wait!  (Tip: on the Yelp app, you can add yourself to their waitlist--it will tell you how long the wait is for your party size and you don't have to arrive until close to that time.)  Lucky for us, I added us to the waitlist, so after I checked in with the host, my party was seated within just a few minutes--it was awesome!

They lost half a star rating because they had ran out of the Chicken St. Charles dish (it was about 2pm when I ordered)--I was so disappointed; was really looking forward to trying this one.  But we did order 3 amazing dishes to share: Eggs Cochon, BBQ Shrimp & Grits, and the Bananas Foster Pain Perdu--all were Ruby Slipper Signature Items.  I do recommend all three--they tasted delicious--but if you don't have a sweet tooth, you can skip the bananas foster (it's a french toast type dish--they don't use the normal thick sandwich bread but instead, a baguette type bread)

My friend had the bacon infused Blood Mary and said it was great (I didn't get a chance to try it).  I had the Screwdriver--it wasn't that great--mostly orange juice and very little vodka.  My other friend had a Ruby Slipper Mimosa (OJ and pomegranate)--it was good--there was tons of sparkling wine in it!

Our server was very friendly but she didn't come around too often--so we were left waiting a couple of times.  However, the food was awesome--I would totally recommend this place for brunch to any friends visiting New Orleans.",2017-06-14 18:46:11

Minus the sausage. The whipped butter and syrup was delicious with this meal. I loved the decor and vibe of the place too.

Okay P love the fact coke was automatically refilled here and I love the fact the Bloody Mary here contained the best thing ever......SPICY PICKLED STRING BEANS. That alone gets 5 stars from me and I wish they would jar this up and sell it. It's so damn good.

But I am sorry, I can't just give this place 5 stars for some garnish or could I come to this restaurant and just order a plate of their pickled string beans.

I came here expecting this place to knock my socks off, but it didn't.

P and I both got the Peacemaker for the Benedict, because we wanted to try more than one and this option gives you the ability to mix and match any two of their signature Benedict.

P got these two:
SHRIMP BOOGALOO BENEDICT - Gulf shrimp sautéed with pork tasso, served over fried green tomatoes & a buttermilk biscuit, topped with poached eggs, finished with Coubion sauce
This didn't look pretty or tasted pretty. WTH is this? At first, I wanted this, but since P ordered it, I didn't want to get the same thing and I was a bit jealous, but after tasting it, we both were like whomp whomp.

EGGS COCHON - Slow-cooked, apple-braised pork debris served over a buttermilk biscuit, 
topped with two poached eggs, finished with hollandaise.
Okay, why is this a popular dish? It wasn't good, I don't know what the hell I am eating here.

CHICKEN ST. CHARLES - Fried chicken breast served over a buttermilk biscuit, topped
with two poached eggs, finished with a pork tasso cream sauce
This was another restaurant favourite and again, why? The chicken is dry and the biscuits are the worst biscuits I ever had in the South. This is blasphemy. I couldn't even eat the biscuits...they were hard as a rock.

HOT-SMOKED SALMON BENNIE - Salmon hot-smoked in-house served over a buttermilk biscuit, topped with two poached eggs, finished with red onion, flash-fried capers & dill hollandaise
Okay, before I even ordered my meal, I was in between what I wanted. I wasn't sure if I should get specialties or the Benedict. When I finally decided just to go with the Peacemaker,, I asked the waitress SPECIFICALLY if I should do the Smoked Salmon, Corn Beef or the Eggs Blackstone. She said, do the Smoked Salmon.
When my dish arrived, I noticed my Smoked Salmon was not smoked at all. It was like a regular cooked salmon, which I hate eating and so I called the waitress over. I said this isn't smoked salmon and she replied, we don't have smoked salmon.
Yes, my bad for overlooking the pre-fix word ""HOT"", but since I didn't even know it was hot, I kept saying Smoked Salmon to this waitress and she even repeated back to me the same thing, SMOKED SALMON. Why would you now say you don't have it? She could have corrected me and said Hot Smoked, but instead she used the same verbiage as me and Smoked Salmon is totally different than Hot Smoked Salmon.
Yeah, I definitely didn't enjoy this dish at all. Salmon is not done well - I can do regular cooked salmon if you have the skills to execute it properly, but this was not the case.

Yeah....nopes. I would definitely come back just for the pickled string beans.",2016-08-22 20:17:58

The bacon pieces are a ""starter"" meal. they do have praline on it so you get this sweet bacon and it is so good !! 
the crawfish Benedict was seasoned well and really good.
but that Hot and Honey chicken with french toast bites is TOP TIER !! i usually HATE chicken but this was so damn good and the french toast bites are covered with cinnamon and have a slight crunchy/fried taste to them. just everything i needed before my flight home !! 
The mimosa was kinda weak ! soon as i saw a dark orange cup hit the table, I knew i was abt to be drinking mostly OJ, but the food is so good i'll let them slide on that one LOL. 

Customer service was on point. Everyone was greeting us with a smile and kind !!

Ok, for a server it's hard because EVERYONE wants their brunch NOW!!!!! and half of them show up hangry or hung over even before the 1-2 hour wait for a table at brunch which is what gives servers at brunch such extraordinary power to make or break the Sunday's of people all over the country.  Good brunch means a good day.  Bad brunch ends in tears, recrimination, divorce!.    With the extraordinary power to shape the entire day of a
 person or group of customers comes
extraordinary responsibility which is something that should be drilled into all wait staff and hosts...along with better pay of course, especially for persons working for Ruby Slipper which is a chain, I.e. corporate, I.e. all you CEO's and admins could definitely pay yourselves less and your wait staff more which would let you hire more competent people.  There, it has been said.  Ruby Slipper out in the Marigny has good Benedict everything, really nice corned beef hash.  Typical reheated hash browns, pretty decent Samosas from a great, responsive, fast bartender. The rest of the service was abysmal.  After putting our names in online an hour and a half
In advance the host informed us it would be about 20-30 minutes more then promptly forgot we existed for about 45 minutes. After reminding the host and getting seated the waitress came by and (this one is on us) we foolishly said give us a minute. 20 or 30 minutes later the waitress came back and on hearing our order informed us that the restaurant was out of the special we wanted. Wish we had been told that right off the bat to save time! Etc etc. It took 45 minutes to get our booby prize order. The best part of the meal was when the table next to us, seated well after us, ordered the special that was ""out"" . It sure looked good while they were eating it.  Since we all know that you get what you pay for, maybe Ruby Slipper could pony up a little more pay for their wait staff and attract more competent waiters.

Ruby Slipper has a great story; the post Katrina establishment was founded on a homecoming for its citizens and with lots of love. Great concept. 

The wait wasn't bad; the line moved fairly quickly and the host/hostess were very pleasant. Our server was energetic and helpful. She wanted us to have the best experience while visiting. 

We ordered from the eggs Benedict side of the menu...the FRIED GREEN TOMATOES, SHRIMP BOOGALOO BENEDICT and CHICKEN ST. CHARLES. I decided to use all caps because I found that menu items get lost among a bunch of words. Lol. 

So the food came. It was fresh, and alright. The biscuits were very good, but what sat atop of them lacked originality and flavor. The seasoning and eggs never got along. I think they divorced and moved to different cities. The chicken and its flavor had an argument this morning, and decided it wasn't coming to breakfast. The sauce was lonely and tried to help make up for the seasonings disappearance, but it was too late. 

The fried green tomatoes looked like they would be seasoned well...no, they just breaded them and let the tomatoes fend for themselves. 

The shrimp dish lacked gulf shrimp. I had another very large cut of a fried green tomato that overpowered the biscuit and eggs and 2 garden shrimps. 

Because of the constant flow of people and the numerous awards and accolades, I expected to be blown away. I expected to eat, sleep, and eat again in one sitting. I expected the 4th of July to happen on July 31st in my mouth. I expected a second line on my tongue. What I got was a basic meal.

pNFhdsnf-AX23zuh-jKQtg,9BEHJ8VJxZvOWltacYELTA,oBNrLz4EDhiscSlbOl8uAw,4,1,0,1,"Ruby Slipper Ratings: 4.4/5 

Food: 4.5/5 - Heard a lot of recommendations about this Brunch place in NOLA, so I have to take my siblings to try it out while we are there. We are glad the wait wasn't too long, and definitely order more than we should, and definitely super stuffed afterwards. You can see the descriptions of our orders below.

- Cinnamon Swirl Pancakes [GET]: Three giant pancakes filled with cinnamon and sugar topped with cream cheese icing. Pancakes were soft and fluffy, with a crispy and buttery outer layer, you can definitely can taste the butter. There's two slices of applewood-smoked bacon served on the side, crispy and tender. The maple syrup was high-quality and tasted amazing. I wasn't a big fan of the cream cheese icing, a bit on the saltier side, but just personal preferences. 

- Sweet Heat Chicken & French Toast Bites [GET]: Fried chicken and fresh strawberries tossed in Mike's Hot Honey Glaze over French toast bites. The fried chicken was phenomenal, super juicy and tasty drenched in sauce, but it wasn't overpowering the chicken. The French toast bites were my favorite. It was airy and light, once again crispy too and dipped in that heavenly sauce. This is the MUST get dish, like chicken with waffles, but much better.  

- Chicken St. Charles Benedicts [GET]: Two fried chicken breast served over a buttermilk biscuit. Fried chicken was tender and juicy. I love the biscuit, because it was moist, buttery, and crunchy on the outer layer. They definitely nailed their biscuits. The eggs was poached perfectly with a running yolk, and finished with a pork Tasso cream sauce. 

- The Peacemaker [GET]: Great option if you cannot decide which Benedicts to get, so you get to mix and match two of their Benedicts. We picked the Bayou Shrimp and Eggs Cochon. The Eggs Cochon was our favorite. The shrimp was fresh, eggs are well poached, and the fried green tomatoes added a great crunch to the Benedict. The pork was well-cooked in their apple-braised pork debris, and the hollandaise sauce gave it a great flavor, and added a nice texture to the biscuits. 

Ambiance: 4.5/5 - Ruby Slipper is located on Magazine Street, walking distance to Jackson Square and the French Quarter. This place has a very cute exterior, looks like the Flatiron building in NYC from an angle. The place is lit with a bunch of people standing in line and waiters bussing to get between us. There's a bar area to sit along with some outdoor seatings as well. Indoor is loud, because it is packed with customers. I would say you can't get any more authentic NOLA experience than having brunch here. 

Price: 4.25/5 - The cinnamon swirl pancakes are $12, sweet heat chicken & French toast bites was $14.50, chicken St. Charles was $15, and lastly the peacemaker is $16. The total after taxes and tips came up to be around $73. Portions are huge, especially the pancakes. We do not know how we finished everything, but definitely left with a food coma. Worth the price I'd say.  

Service: 4.25/5 - I think everyone here was friendly and helpful. The lady at the front was nice, and made sure we were on the waitlist. Our server was attentive, provided some good recommendations and let us know that the kitchen is backed up with orders. The food still came out in a reasonable time, hot and fresh. Had a great experience for sure. 

BLUF: A popular and famous brunch spot you should visit while in NOLA. Make sure to put your name down on the waitlist on their website, and check-in with the host for a shorter wait time. I recommend the Eggs Cochon Benedicts and the Sweet Heat Chicken & French Toast Bites, best dishes at Ruby Slipper.",2021-12-28 16:55:37

It took over an hour to get a seat at the bar. Unfortunately there was a sour smell where I was sitting and the bartender did not pay me much mind. The food was subpar and the iced coffee was more of a dessert than actual coffee. 

In addition, the Bloody Mary seems to be a very popular drink as they keep a large batch stored in bins on the bar. However, it sits for too long and makes a crust around the edge which did not seem very appealing to me. It was very crowded and took foreverrrer for food to come.",2021-07-04 22:23:51

The drinks. I'm sorry but not so much. The Irish coffee, cold brew coffee, and margarita. We didn't end up drinking. 1/10. 

I got a sample of two Benedict's! The one with pork and another with fried chicken. And let me tell you my mouth is watering just thinking about it. The sauce was so rich yet light. Couldn't get enough of it! The chicken so crispy. And the pork was marinaded through and through. And the biscuit I don't know where to begin, it was so moist. The perfect in-between of sweet and savory. 

I also got the appetizer French toast. Don't be fooled by how plain it looks but the bread they use is so fluffy and sweet! But not overly sweet. It was so yummy I should have ordered the full portion.",2021-11-07 16:01:19

Both seafood dishes obviously but that's what I came for. It is supposed to be one of the best places for seafood and in fact it doesn't disappoint.
The mix of creole and seafood it's the right kind of flavor I was looking for. Both specialties-of-the-house dishes were incredible tasteful. One was the lightly fried catfish in a crostini over sautéed spinach and artichokes with pork tasso (which I discovered here and was completely new fort me) and finished with a tomato creole sauce that kicked ass. The other one, a must! The gulf fish pan seared in top of a grit and cheese cake dressed with sautéed spinach, cherry tomatoes and garnished with a killer killer mustard-like creole sauce. They were both amazing and enormous plates. To share for sure but we were very hungry after a long flight. 
Prices are inexpensive for the amount of food you have but the tax is pretty high like 9% or more I'd say.

I ordered French toast, applewood bacon and a side of diced potatoes. It was mediocre and nothing about any of the items stood out. Good but not great.

Everyone else ordered pancakes, breakfast sandwich with pork, BBQ grits n grilled shrimp and banana foster pancakes and seemed to enjoy their meals. Our server Racquel was great and very attentive!

This is a small location. The hostess was definitely overwhelmed checking vaccination cards, cleaning tables and then doing hosting duties but stayed friendly throughout all of it.  Once we sat down it was a bit more calmer. The staff is great and despite the busy morning we had sufficient check-ins.

Food was fantastic. The pictures don't do it justice. The weakest thing we had was a seasonal winter beignets in chocolate sauce. Otherwise everything else was *drool* yum.

The french toast bites were like fried air crisps dipped in heavenly sauce. The crawfish and grits  Benedict was a creative take on the dish and out the very competent salmon Benedict I had as part of my duo to shame. The banana foster pain perdu was decadent. Just about everything was great. Only downside was a limited kids menu. My younger one wanted chocolate chip pancakes which they could not do so she got the regular ones.

The food was mediocre at best, cold and lacked flavor. However, the service was amazing! The waitresses and manger were super nice. 
The vibes are really good, and the story behind the name was nice and the decor was cute and fun. However, the food was not all that. 
We ordered - 
1. White chocolate banana pudding pancakes 
Overall they had lots of flavor, but they were cold and seemed undercooked. 
2. Breakfast potatoes - overall these were okay, but I don't think they were worth the price. 
3. Fries- my fries were cold, and tasted stale. 
4. Toast - unfortunately my toast was also cold and slightly mushy. 
5. 2 biscuits w the syrup cane butter. - my biscuit was a little cold, but the butter was delish. 
6. I also ordered a coke and it was flat. 
The menu also said that it had vegan options, however they basically sum up to some toast, blast potatoes and oatmeal, which as nice as it is, isn't anything glorious. 
Overall- 
Pros- 
Really nice service- I had asked if I could switch my cold food out for something else and the manger came over and accommodated quickly. 
Cute story 
Good flavors on the pancake, but cold. 
Cons- 
Cold food 
A bit crowded, but just put your name on the guest list on yelp before you arrive and it should be fine. We didn't wait that long before we got bar seating.

Coffee was food too but not like cafe du monde stuff ( so I would just walk down there for coffee) but it comes in such a cute ruby slipper mug. 

I saw their banana caramel  French toast on the table next to me which looked soooo good!! Would have had that too if I had a bottomless stomach. 

My friend got the southern breakfast platter which looked okay but nothing special. I think Benedict's are the way to go here?",2019-03-27 14:24:51

Omg wow! The southern breakfast is a good, stick to your ribs kind of thing - 2 eggs, grits, a fried green tomato, 2 slices of bacon, and a biscuit with cane butter. The stuffed French toast was a massive portion of French toast with cheesecake filling and blueberry compote. Both were delicious! 

Because it was so good the first time around, and had some interesting local color (the drunk guy at 8am), we decided to back this time with my dad and some friends.

Mom and I again split the southern breakfast, this time with the bananas foster pain perdu, while my dad got the stuffed French toast and my friend got the pancake flight.

We had seen the pain perdu on our previous visit, and man, it's even better than it looks. Sugar rush! My friends pancake flight was also completely awesome - bacon pecan, cinnamon swirl, and blueberry pancakes. Wow!

My first visit here was summer of 2014 while pregnant with my son and the customer service was so amazing and the food came out Hot, Fast & Fresh.

Our second visit was during that same summer of 2014 and that visit didn't fall short of the first.

However the 3rd time should be a charm but it sadly wasn't only due to the service. Our server was horrible he barely brought us water we waited at least 35mins for water and ended up calling over another server to take our order just because we observed her momentum and attitude with her tables and we witnessed others who sat after us get their food order taken and drinks brought out all all.

I try to give a place 2-3 shots to get it right before reviewing if I know I'll be in the area. 

My go to dish is the Banana Fosters French Toast with a side of scrambled egg whites. This visit I tried the chicken sausage only to feed to our son but they were not tasty not properly cooked so I wouldn't suggest them. My husband always order a omelet and out teenager ordered the regular French toast which is enjoyed.

Breakfast was extremely limited in NOLA until after Katrina so to find a decent restaurant was exciting which is why we frequent this place.",2016-07-07 03:14:26

It was very hard to choose I wanted something lighter but also wanted the Bananas Foster French Toast. My hubby ordered the French toast and I nibbled on it! I got something off the lighter fare which was the skinny migas. Both were delicious.

Let's talk about the bananas foster French toast. This was the best French toast I've had in my life. I had BFFT at another establishment a day or two later and it was also very good. But it was better at Ruby Slipper. I think my only issue with it was that they use baguette for the bread, which has a high crust ratio. So even with all the rum syrup/sauce, it can be kinda hard to cut. But this is me being a little bit nit picky. If you've got your heart set on sweet, it's worth the wait for this French toast.
