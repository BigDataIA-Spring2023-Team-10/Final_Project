Our server was really friendly and gave us a quick rundown of the menu, and we got the crawfish beignet as an appetizer from the checking on Yelp. Apparently the appetizer isn't free like the Yelp check-in says but it's -$10 for whatever appetizer you get. Anyway, we ordered a bunch of food including two platters of oysters, and we then we started waiting. And waiting. After maybe twenty minutes, our first platter of oysters came, closely followed by the second plate. We noticed the second plate wasn't what we ordered so we asked the waiter who took it back. We then waited for another twenty or thirty minutes for our food, and our entrees came. Our oysters never did. We told the waiter and he said there was a mixup and our oysters were given to the table next to us. The manager came by afterward and told us that she'd give us two orders of what we got on the house (too bad I don't really eat oysters). So I ate my crawfish etouffee and it was quite good. A bit salty, but good. Nice spicy flavor and a good amount of crawfish, both fried bits on top and in the sauce. I asked for more bread as well so I could soak up the sauce. I quite enjoyed that dish. When the oysters finally came after we had already all finished our meal (this was probably another 10-15 minutes), the Rockefeller oysters came and I tried one. Way too much cheese on top! Otherwise I think ok as far as oysters go. Then we asked for the check do which also took at least five minutes to get here. My crawfish dish was $17 pre-tax which is a bit pricey, and combined with the mixup and the super long waiting times, I wouldn't suggest coming here. The waiter apologized many times for the mixup which is fine, but it doesn't excuse the super long wait times for our main entrees. To be fair, my food (the crawfish etouffee) was quite good and deserves 4 stars, but the long long long wait and inefficiencies (I'm excusing the mix-up with the oysters because there was a miscommunication which I understand happens - what isn't excusable is how long we waited for our entrees/other dishes, the check, etc etc) subtracted 1 star.",2017-01-02 13:44:50

Service is very attentive, and food is everything for which one could wish for in New Orleans.

They even messed up one of the tomato slices in the po-boy.  Three out of four were good, one slice was bad.  How do you mess up a slice of tomato?  All you have to do is a pick a good tomato and cut it.

It was one of the worst places I have ever eaten in my entire life. I would eat some dirty street food before eating or drinking here again. First and foremost, we had the worst service, the fellow we had didn't even deserve a tip, his service was atrocious at best. We started with drinks I ordered a pear martini and my other ordered a bloody mary. The pear martini was made with the Worst tasting ingredients of all time and so much melon liquor that is all I could taste.  so bad. The bloody mary I am told was just as bad and overly salty. (We never got another drink because the server was too busy to wait on us and never again once throughout the entire meal asked if we wanted a water or another drink). We then ordered the spinach and artichoke dip which was actually very good, it is a very simple thing to make. Unfortunately, when the waiter took our drink order when he took our food order as well and we never saw him again until we were finished with our meals. I ordered the steak because I don't eat seafood. First mistake because it is USDA choice beef being the worst quality of beef with a better name. The steak came out under cooked, flavorless and cold. It said Cajun and creole, this is laughable!!! The sides were just as bad as the steak, cold and flavorless. My other ordered gumbo and oysters. The gumbo was flavorless and to his knowledge there was no seafood in a seafood gumbo. As horrible and repulsive as the oysters looked to me and my other half, he said they tasted fine and they didn't make him sick so that is all that matters. But if you could see oysters before you bought them we wouldn't of bought them because they looked like the lowest quality oysters ever. If our server would of came back and asked how our meal was I would of sent mine back and asked for nothing else. I ate about a quarter of a $30.00 steak when the server took my plate he didn't even ask if I was done or how my meal was. He took my others plate and again didn't ask him if he was done and he was in fact still eating. (this was again the first time we saw our waiter since he took our order and no other server checked on us through the entire meal).

Nothing tasted particularly fresh. Mostly tasted like it came from those massive frozen food trailers you see on the highway. Nothing felt like someone was really ""cooking"" it. Nothing absolutely awful but not worth the price and wait. 

The taste of New Orleans wasn't very good. The gumbo was way over spiced, etouffee was soupy, and jambalaya was dry and bland. The rice in all was slightly under cooked. Not a good representation of the city. Crawfish ravioli was just regular red sauce with some spice and micro sized crawfish dropped in. No crawfish was in the ravioli. Huge let down when it was the same frozen ravioli from Sam's club for a 30 dollar dish. 

Couldn't sit upstairs due to a last minute private party that took the space. Had to sit in a cramped space near the bar. Loud area by the sidewalk, not much space to back up your chair without smashing into another patrons chair.

We sat outside on the balcony watching the crowd walk past on Royal St. Great atmosphere on a late Saturday afternoon. The service was a bit slow, otherwise would have given 5 stars.",2015-01-18 16:45:14

My wife had the pecan crusted mahi mahi, which turned out too spicy for her and they were kind enough to change her order free of charge. Note that it didn't look anything like what we expected based on the description. She ended up having the eggplant and chicken Parmesan which tasted amazing (5 stars)

The staff were very nice and friendly, the place isn't 5 star quality but the food is great!

We had a free spinach dip appetizer courtesy of Yelp, which wasn't fresh honestly and the nachos were extremely oily! We've had better. (2 stars)

The dip was the best part and it quickly went down from there. The shrimp po boy was way too dry. I thought these things had a sauce that went in it? The boiled shrimp pot was not spicy at all, despite the waitress warning us it would be spicy. The shrimp on the platter lacked flavor and was chewy. Would we come back?

We were a big group and got things to share:
-Fried Alligator: I hated the thought of eating an alligator, but the fried alligator wasn't so bad! It kind of tasted like chicken, you must try this! I wish they gave us more. It wasn't too salty but could use less...
-Spinach Dip: Nothing fancy, the name says it all!
-Crab claws: I really thought we were going to get ""crab claws"" instead it seems more of a soup. The dipping sauce was overwhelming and engulfs the crab claws. Extremely salty dipping sauce.
-Seafood Pescatore: Very spicy! A great spicy kick to it, everything else was salty, but seafood was fresh
-Baked Shrimp Tortellini: The saltiest dish ever. Don't know why the tortellinis were so salty. The shrimp in it was good, tasted very gritty. 
-Blackened Shrimp & Jambalaya: Wasn't too salty, but could use less. Shrimp was excellent and a good jambalaya, not as ""juicy"" as I would like but overall a decent dish
-Royal House Burger: The name says it all... it wasn't too bad for a Cajun/Creole place!

Over server was super cool and told us to always check the bill here because places add on extra charges (like gratuity) and not tell you around Mardi Gras. Also you get the ""Mardi Gras Menu"" aka the overly priced food because they can. I've eaten Cajun food in Cali (but not from the source-NOLA) but in Cali it's not salty like the Cajun here...so maybe it's a regional thing, but all the food was just too salty for us.

Our server, Tina, was really friendly and helpful. She recommended the Absolut Strawberry Lemonade and Mandarin Dreamsicle. We got both, and I loved the lemonade! It was refreshing, fruity, and sweet! It had a strawberry and two slices of lemon in it. My husband got the Dreamsicle, and we expected it to taste like a creamsicle. It kind of did... but also kindof tasted like medicine. We would order that again.

The fried alligator had moist meat, and came with cocktail and tartar sauce. It was good, but tiny portions. We saw a video of the oysters duo, that it'd be sizzling when it got to the table. It wasn't. And, it was lukewarm, at best. We came when the restaurant was pretty empty too, so I'm not sure why our food wasn't hot. Also, taste wise, for which I'm not sure temperature played a role in, was mediocre. Acme chargrilled oysters are WAY BETTER.

The pasta, Tina recommended we swap out the marinara sauce to a white wine sauce. It was a good idea! So tasty! Again, portions were tiny, and I'm pretty sure we had empty clam shells, but the scallops were cooked really well.

Overall, pretty tasty food, but just tiny portions. Also, we couldnt get a free appetizer from their Yelp deal, because we have to order two entrees, and we didn't :(",2016-05-31 02:24:38

on Yelp where to go for a special Sunday seafood dinner. We chose Royal House because of their excellent reviews and the fact that you receive a free appetizer 
when checking in on yelp.
First we ordered 2 drinks and an appetizer. After waiting almost 30 minutes our entrees arrived and no appetizer. When we inquired about our appetizer they were surprised and took our dinners back and returned with the crab claws we ordered, 
Again we waited and waited and no food as we watched others come and go. By this time our drinks were finished I decided to get the check and leave. When we received the check they had charged us for the ""free"" appetizer. At this point I asked for a manager. The manager returned with our check and said he would take care of the overcharge. We waited an additional 15 minutes for him to finally
tell us that we weren't being charged and we could leave.
Almost one and a half hours and no food.

Ambiance:
Loud, hustle and bustle of the FQ. Expect it and plan accordingly. Music outside and just a block from Bourbon. This side of FQ has a tamer side to it. If at all possible try to be seated upstairs and in the balcony if it's just you and a date. Expect to wait for dinner.

Food: 
Crab Claws 10/5
This dish alone will bring your back. It did for us. They use a cajun compound butter with 18-23 pieces of crab claws. We've counted since we've had this dish 3 times. It comes with 4 pieces of buttered french bread. I've looked up the recipe and they call it a Bourdelaise Sauce. Truly an amazing dish that is great and consistent. Give yourself time when enjoying this dish. Don't pair it with too many things that would clutter your meal. Space it out and enjoy it with a drink or two. This dish is that amazing.

Redfish Beignets 4/5
It was definitely a treat and unique to NOLA. So imagine funnel cake with fish inside, powdered sugar, and a spicy cream sauce. It sounds like it shouldn't work but this almost exemplifies all of NOLA. I don't know how but this dish works. Logic and common sense would tell you ""no"" but this dish screams in defiance what the world is telling you is good.

Drink: N/A
Only had water. It was super humid even at night.

Service: 10/5 (for the 2 visits we were there)
I honestly can't say enough about the service that was provided here from Chris. Very knowledgeable and understanding. First off, Chris is more of a guide then a server. He leads you to where you want to go. He does it in a manner that is very enjoyable and comfortable. He truly led us to having a wonderful night. If at any time you can remember your server's name from 2 weeks out it says something about the time you had at a restaurant.

The building seems to be very old and have some history to it. Apparently, one of the characters in American Horror Story: Coven was based off of the owner the mansion that is now Royal House. Creepy! 

The reception was held in an upstairs dining room conveniently with a bar.  There is also a wrap around balcony, good for people watching. Although the balcony is a bit narrow and leans a bit. If you're afraid of heights, be wary. lol

The food was served buffet style with a good variety of New Orleans cuisine such as crawfish etouffee, gumbo, redfish, dirty rice, and bread pudding. My favorite of the night was definitely the etouffee. I had five bowls of the etoufee over rice. 

I also was able to order some oysters from the bar and have them brought up. I was not able to try oysters from anywhere else on my trip to compare, but the oysters at Royal House were great! The Gulf oysters were a good size, not too big or too small and meaty. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the bill was only $13 for a dozen... I could have put away another four dozen, but I did not want to spew out oysters all over Bourbon street as there was a four hour open bar that night.... 

Service at the reception was very friendly and prompt. It seems that people have experienced different service according to other reviews. But ours was great.

Bright and airy, with a distinctively Parisian vibe, the Royal House is a great choice for a casual (or not-so-casual) bite in the French Quarter close to Bourbon. 

Service was *very* friendly, our waiter made a ton of recommendations and steered us clear of some items he said were overrated. We made conversation and he ended up recommending me a list of often-ignored French Quarter bars that we should check out. He genuinely seemed like he loved his town and job, and it made the whole vibe even better.

Started with the chargrilled oysters which were delicious, and then an alligator po-boy which was pretty good, didn't blow me away. My girlfriend had the blackened shrimp jambalaya which definitely needed to be spiced up some more but once it was, it was delicious.

-1 star for the pricing -- it's standard tourist French Quarter upcharge, although I don't know why I'd expect otherwise. There's probably better jambalaya and po-boys at better prices around.

Our server FINALLY came out after 9 minutes. I know this because I checked in on Yelp. He was either sick or had a drug problem because he kept sucking snot up his nose and running his finger across his nose. Either way, it was disgusting. I tried to let it go.

I asked for a wine list. Five minutes later I received one. I asked for a Chardonnay. My server asked me if that was a white wine. What?  Did that just happen?  A well known NOLA restaurant, that has a two page wine list, does not train its servers?

Then he said they might be out. Another few minutes later, I was told they were out of all white wine except for two. There was an entire page of options. How is that possible?  I accepted it. I order an Abita Amber beer. And then I waited. Another table said they had not gotten service either.

They were super accommodating as we are evacuees from hurricane Irma and had two dogs with us. The host Arrow, who was so friendly, quickly got us a table, was very accommodating with a table with open doors for pups. They are dog friendly (that they were very accommodating to give my dog water and make sure my dogs were comfortable). They had open doors at the restaurant which made the experience amazing for all of us. Thank you to our waitress Heidi for the amazing service!  Now onto the food... My fiancé had the red beans and rice and alligator bites.  I had the gumbo. All was delicious, and very fresh! I can't stress it enough it is a must!!!!!!",2017-09-10 00:19:25

Ordered shrimp creole (18$) and a cup of gumbo ($7).

So we wandered around trying to find a comfortable but inexpensive restaurant for breakfast. Eventually, we stumbled across the Royal House and, encouraged by the staffer with the megaphone, came on in.

We were seated by the open doors making the experience practically al fresco. The breakfast menu was limited albeit focused on Southern/New Orleans cuisine. My wife had the Oysters Benedict and I had the Southerner entrée made up of biscuits and gravy with ground sausage and scrambled eggs. Our server was chatty and friendly in that familiar New Orleans way. She was also thoughtful, adding my requested side order of grits as a ""lagniappe"" to my meal.

Our waiter recommended the Stuffed Mushrooms, which we tried and absolutely loved. I'm not a big mushroom fan in general, but I couldn't get enough of them. They have a nice selection of local brews, he had the Jockamo IPA and loved it. 

I ordered the Crawfish Ravioli, and he got the Pecan Crusted Mahi Mahi. The ravioli was absolutely delicious, but his Mahi Mahi was definitely burnt.

We were seated immediately around noon in the surprisingly empty restaurant and were overwhelmed with the menu. The waiter helped us through it and told us some of the most popular dishes (all of which were brought up in reviews on Yelp already). We ended up getting the Crab Claws, the Chargrilled Oysters, the Royale Oysters and the Taste of New Orleans paired with two Sam Adams. 

The oysters were probably the best I've ever had. They were super fresh and seasoned amazingly. At first I thought the chargrilled oysters were too much because of the amount of sauce/cheese but I scooped some of it off and it was PERFECT. The Royale oysters were cooked to perfection and went reallyw well with the seafood topping. I highly recommend pairing these with beers because we really enjoyed it.

The crab claws came out next and despite the rave reviews it got on Yelp, I wasn't impressed. It was barely warm enough and bland compared to the rest of the food. By itself the flavor wasn't bad but it just paled in comparison. We also didn't think it was that fresh because it didn't seem warm enough and it was in that awkward maybe-it's-supposed-to-be-crispy-or-maybe-not phase. 

The taste of New Orleans was above average in my eyes. I LOVED the crawfish étouffée and kinda wished I got that by itself. The jambalaya was also good with nice flavors but a little dry. And finally the gumbo wasn't bad. I liked it but it wasn't mind-blowing. This dish would probably get a 3.5/5 for me. 

However, the service was awesome and the oysters made the trip worth it. I would definitely recommend coming here!!

Update: we couldn't stop talking about the oysters and ended up coming back the next day for more!! 

We got the Rockefeller oysters and the second grilled oysters (forgot the name - starts with an M?) Just as good as we remembered. Each oyster has its own unique flavor and seasoning but they're all cooked to perfection. 

If I could, I would just come here for the oysters. Super tasty!",2015-08-20 05:26:56

Our party of 8 was there for over two hours and after we were done eating we waited for our check for 30 minutes. They forgot one person's burger and another entree was cold and had to be sent back. The restaurant was not busy. They don't split checks either which caused more problems than the food was worth. Better options in the city for sure.,2017-05-01 01:38:59

I then had the peel-and-eat shrimp boil which was delicious. Usually you find peel-and-eat shrimp served cold so I was very excited to try these piping hot ones. They're boiled with Cajun spices and served with potatoes and corn. SO GOOD!

We couldn't decide between all the different types of oysters we don't have the option of back home so he brought us two of each, which was perfect. the amount of breading and parm they added to some of them took away from the taste of the oyster itself but all of them were delicious and I'm glad we got to try some. We got the blackened redfish and taste of new orleans so we could test out some jambalaya and gumbo. All of it was spot on delicious and just what we wanted.

The food was super mediocre (crawfish and crab ravioli) that may have been just regular frozen ravioli. The dough was thick, the filling flavorless.

My biggest upset was the service. I sat at the bar and to my horror, considering this is a ""nicer"" seafood restaurant, was being served by a guy (my check said Larry) who kept referring to me as ""sweetheart"" and had a full mouth of gold and silver teeth.

What the f*ck. I get handed my check and the first words out of Larry's mouth are ""Anything you write on here...""

We noticed the sign for the Royal House as we meandered about the local Outlet Mall. As we made our way towards to restaurant, I thought about all the delicious oysters I was about to consume. As we entered the restaurant, we were greeted by a gentleman (who's name escapes me) who gave us a beautiful smile and immediately accepted our request to sit on the upstairs balcony. Because I live in Las Vegas, as a native southerner, I could feel a thunderstorm in the air and I did not want to miss it. As we made our way upstairs, our host inquired about our day and referred to us as ""his Queens"" which I found, quite frankly, adorable. As we approached the balcony, we saw mainly two tops and since we were a three, decided on sitting inside with the windows open and a great view of the street blow. I had a smoke on the balcony in anticipation on the dozen raw oysters I had ordered. I wanted a hundred but decided a dozen would do! They did not disappoint. They were plump, delicious and fresh. My aunt's fried oyster puff pastry, my crab salad and my cousin's chicken sandwich were all delicious. Eric, our server, delivered impeccable service. Upon his suggestion, I ordered the chocolate brownie sundae as dessert. It was a perfect ending. We were clearly Eric's last table, and being in the hospitality industry myself, I noticed he was in no way shape or form rushing us through our meal.  As we left, I made sure to let the host know how much I appreciated his hospitality.

I'm going to chalk it up to out of town people that really don't know good seafood or service. I am from the south so my expectations are high for service and seafood. We arrived around 2 on a Sunday and was promptly greeted and seated. The waitress was dealing with another customer so she told us she would be with us shortly. We looked over the menu and waited for awhile before she returned. I chalked it up to her being a tad busy so i wasn't upset. We had time to look over the menu several times so we went ahead and placed our order, everything from drinks, apps to entree. We settled on the oyster duo with a side of crawfish etoufee and the shrimp platter with a side of gumbo. We also ordered the oyster tacos as a app. 

We were seated on the balcony and we talked as we people watched. The app came fairly quickly and it consistents of 4 taco chips with oyster and slaw on top of them. I don't know how that can be classified as taco not nacho but to each its own. The app was pretty good, although i could taste the grit from the oyster. The overall taste was a good starter. 

This is where the meal goes downhill. We waited for over 40 mins on our meal. I watched a second line come and go. I listened to at least 5 songs from the street performers. I even watched a lady raise money for her little pig. One thing i didn't see was any food coming to my table. We finally asked the waitress how much longer. Her response was let me go downstairs and check. Well low and behold, her comes our meal. 

The oysters were room temp so they must have been sitting there. The etoufee was meh. The gumbo was pretty good and the shrimp platter was so not worth the price. I was so disappointed that i waited for this meal.

First off, the food took forever to come out - over 30 minutes after we ordered. Secondly, our crab salad was pathetic. For a $18 salad, that ""crab salad"" was a fried mess on even shabbier spinach leaves. The shrimp in the shrimp po boy was small and miserly. The Oysters on the Half Shell was the most disgusting oyster I've ever had. I'm sorry, but this baked (or grilled - I'm not sure) was stuffed with this SUPER garlicky, cheesy, salty mixture that completely masked the flavor of the oyster itself. I ate one and couldn't eat another. My bf liked it though, but it wasn't for me. And the gumbo was way too spiced and seasoned. The only good thing was the service. The location is fairly centralized as well. Due to the long wait, they gave us free drinks (sodas) and 10% off the bill. We also had the crab salad taken off because, well, just look at the picture. Would you pay $18 for that?

There was a little bit of a wait to get in (no reservations), but only about 15 minutes long. Way better than ACME down the street with its 3 hour wait.

I had read that the Royal House had tasty oysters, so we decided to have a light lunch here. I ordered half a dozen raw oysters, and half a dozen Oysters Royale. The raw oysters were good, but not nearly as large as the ones that Acme or Felix's serves. Mine were also not cleaned very well. Every single oyster had shell or some kind of debris in it. The Oyster Royale were good and I'd suggest them if someone didn't want to try the raw oysters.
 
My mom had the Crab Louis Salad. She said that it probably would have been better had the crab not been tempura-battered, but it was probably more of a personal preference thing. She said that the salad did fill her up and that the rest of the ingredients were really fresh. Our waiter was very attentive and made sure that we had everything that we needed.
 
The host that seated us was a bit of a downer as he seemed like we were making his job hard. There were two of us that came for lunch, and didn't have a seating preference, so I'm not sure how we made his job hard.

I really wish I could give this ANYTHING higher than a 2 stars. I had pretty high expectations after seeing some of the reviews here (even from other yelpers that I know). My friends and I were able to get a seat here 10 minutes after calling in ahead of time the day of (A Sunday). 

We were seated in a awkward long table by the second floor entrance where the noise level was a bit excessive. People were coming up and down the stairs so it was a bit hard to have a conversation. Our server was friendly enough, when my boyfriend found a rando piece of sharp clam shell hidden inside his NON SEAFOOD Chicken Sandwich, our server was quick to correct things by bringing out the restaurant manager. 

Overall, it was a subpar dining experience. After being seated almost immediately we still had to wait well over an hour for our food to come out, the clam shell piece incident kind of had us all wary of every bite we took. The food in general already was pretty bad and everything was pretty pricey. 
Specifically I'd like to point this out in regards to food but we ordered what we thought was shrimp and grits -- HOWEVER, this new version (as of 05/15/2016) SUCKS. It was two fried blocks of grits, covered in this insanely weird creole-y sauce with way too much cheese covering everything. 3/8 of us ordered this dish and collectively agreed that it was pretty much sadness on a plate. Another thing that was way off-- the mint julep. SUPER strong with little to no mint/sugar flavor to compliment it. My friend actually had to ask our server to bring it back to add some sugar to offset the insanely strong alchy taste it had.",2016-05-20 06:45:05

We also tried the red fish blackened and the Cajun shrimp. While the fish was cooked well and had good flavor, it was underwhelming compared to similar fish choices (at similar prices) in San Francisco where we flew in from

My friend and I checked in to get the free appetizer and chose spinach artichoke dip which ended up being the highlight of the meal.

We had clams royale which I had been craving since we landed and did not satisfy that craving at all, which surprised me since oysters were one of the things people mentioned repeatedly. For our main entrees, my friend got jambalaya she had been craving and I got the shrimp and grits. My friend said the jambalaya she had at Mother's the next day was much better than the mediocre one at Royal House. The Shrimp and grits were a complete disappointment on my end.

However, there were numerous other issues. We were seated at a very small table for four people when really only should have been used for 2 people! But they didn't seem to care despite having empty tables nearby. Our waiter was Joe and he was not the most attentive waiter. We did not have great service and despite the restaurant not being too busy the food still came out quite slow. He took an awfully long time to bring us a glass of wine even after ordering it after we sat down. 

First, we ordered the oyster tacos appetizer, and for one thing, chips are not a taco. You should not be calling them tacos when you place oysters on 5 tortilla chips. Secondly, the oyster tacos have a super SPICY sauce on top which they don't even mention on the menu!! I love spicy things but they slathered the sauce on each chip that you could barely taste the oyster and your lips go numb as soon as you swallow. When I asked our waiter Joe about the sauce he said it was a chipotle pepper sauce and I mentioned it was terribly spicy and he walked away as if he didn't care about satisfied customers. Either put it on the menu, put a small drop on each oyster, or have the waiter inform you when ordering it! 

The pecan mahi mahi was good but you couldn't really taste that it was pecan. Etouffee was good. Blackened shrimp and jambalaya left little to be desired. 

During our meal, one of the busboys ran into my sister's arm hard but didn't notice nor apologize. Then, that same busboy knocked over a glass he was carrying and also slammed down plates at the table next to us.

- Oysters: huge; not bad with hot sauce, lemon, and horseradish 
- Oysters Rockefeller: too rich for me but good when hot 
- French onion soup: very cheesy, standard savory onion soup - good for a cold night  
- Crab: a whole snow crab, which was nicely peppered, but the texture was as if it was previously frozen. No accompaniments
- Hush puppies: not as much corn flavor as I expected. I liked that they were small for more surface area to volume ratio (ie more crispness outside), but it wasn't hot by the time we got it 
- Crab ravioli: cheese ravioli wasn't very special, but the crab and tomato sauce wasn't bad
- New Orleans trio: gumbo was ok, crawfish étouffée was good, dirty rice was pretty good

There was a wait for the great tables alongside the windows downstairs and on the balcony on the second level, but we got a nice table upstairs. Our server (a young Molly Ringwald type) greeted us quickly and was ready to take our drink order. Only two beers on tap - Abita Amber and Shock Top. Having the latter should have been a sign - I always wonder why a ""local"" place would dedicate half its' taps to an Anheiser Busch product?

We got a free appetizer for checking in thru Yelp, and got the redfish fritters our server recommended. They're fried dough strips with a little fish weaves in served with a slightly spicy, sweet syrup. They were ok, nothing special. We really liked the half and half oyster combo, with the Royale and Rockefeller baked oysters.

My partner enjoyed her Seafood Pescatore, but I had issues with my Crawfish Etoufee. When it was served it was barely warm. I returned it, then waited while my partner almost finished her meal before my replacement returned. It was hot now, steaming inferno hot, but the sauce had formed a skin over it like it had been in the oven or microwave for a long time. There were teeny, hard to find crawfish in a dish that was supposed to highlight that ingredient. They reminded me of the dried shrimp treats we have at home as cat treats. The sauce was bland and needed quite a few shakes of Tabasco to have any flavor. Very disappointing. I had the jambalaya at Zatarains Kitchen at the airport the next day that was far superior.

Our bill was about $75, and we were bummed to have chosen Royal House for our last dinner in New Orleans. It was our worst meal in 12 nights in the Big Easy.",2014-05-08 16:53:00

I had shrimp creole and hushpuppies topped with a lemon drop martini.  I picked the shrimp creole at the encouragement of the staff who thought it was fresher and more plentiful than the crawfish étouffée.  It was fine-- fresh-- no complex seasonings, not worth ordering again.  The hushpuppies were a tasty treat.  Our son had the crablouise salad-- lovely but not worth writing home about.  The prices are reasonable.  Most importantly, however, the atmosphere on a beautiful day is fantastic.

Several more minutes later we got the app. The oyster were amazing which is why I'm giving this place a three star review. Absolutely freaking amazing, hot and fresh.

The raw oysters were tasty, the stuffed oysters were good, and the rockefeller were also good. The bloody mary that the wife started with was one of the best of her life. Maybe THE best.

Unfortunately, it did not really have breakfast but they looked like they had pretty good oysters. My boyfriend had not had the opportunity this trip to get oysters yet so we decided to give it a try. 

First off, the service. The service was fantastic. The host made a point of talking to us, asked how many, sat us at our table, etc. The usual. However, he also let us know where the bathrooms were, the bar, who our server would be and really made us feel at home and comfortable. It was something that was easy but quickly set the Royal House apart. Our server was named Robert. He was also really nice. Originally we were planning on using a ""check-in deal"" from Yelp that allowed a free appetizer with a purchase. However, Robert informed us you had to buy two entrees that cost a specific amount and since we were just looking for something light we decided to skip the deal and give it a try anyways. In the middle of the meal a parade went down Royal Street for the Sugar Bowl. We were trying to peer out the windows to see and Robert made a point of coming over and telling us to just head outside and check out the parade, and ""no one will bother our food."" After the parade, one of the employees walked around delivering beads to ALL of the customers that he had collected during the parade. Service was definitely a 5 star. 

The food (and drinks). We started with a Bloody Mary each. They infused vodka in house which we were really excited to try. The drinks were good, but they were a little thin at the end and being in New Orleans for a few days I was hoping for a great Bloody Mary where you could taste the seasonings the whole time and never thinned out from ice. The food was good. Ben liked his oysters a lot and thought they were really fresh. We split some spinach dip and an order of hush puppies. Both were good, but unfortunately none of the food was amazing. 

I would definitely return for the service!",2013-01-04 21:38:32

Our main guy was Antoine. While the bar was busy he never failed to check on us. 
The food came out super fast even though the restaurant was packed with Mardi Gras Goers. 

We ordered the Crawfish Cakes it came with 2 cakes that was delightful and full of flavor. 

My friend and I also shared the Taste of New Orleans entrée. If it was up to me I would have just the crawfish Etouffée  with some bread and be satisfied. 

There was also another bartender that we got a drink from named Sisqo. Ask him to make you his specialty shot. He wont tell you the ingredients in it. ""its top secret"" but it was delicious. Lemon in flavor.

We appreciate the great service that we got from Antoine and Sisqo. It made this experience of being in NOLA more memorable when its accompanied with superior service.

We called around 7:15 to see if there was a wait.  The hostess said it'd be about 20 minutes, but asked for our name.  We gave her our info and said we'd be there within a half hour.

Half hour later, we showed up.  The hostess said it'd be about a 10 minute wait, which was fine by us.  We waited outside -- it was a beautiful night with low humidity and a light breeze.

Five minutes later the manager appeared to apologize for the long wait (what long wait?!) saying it'd be another 5 minutes.  He offered us complimentary drinks.  Don't mind if we do!  He took us to the bar, we ordered drinks and about a minute later, our table was ready.

We were shown to our table and greeted by our waitress who seemed to be in a frenzy.  She said she'd be right back, though right back was about 10 minutes later.  Thankfully we had our drinks already and weren't in any sort of rush.  She was very, very slow the rest of the night, but we were all taking our time eating and talking, so we didn't mind.  Normally this would have bothered me.

Onto the food...I tried the egglant appetizer -- I've actually never had eggplant and I have to say, I was not a fan, but my friends loved it.  For dinner, I got the Chicken Marsala, which was very good, but the sauce was a little thicker than I like.  The pasta was great and the chicken was plentiful and very juicy.  Normally I prefer chicken breast over cutlet, but it was still very good.  My friends all enjoyed their meals, as well.

The ambiance was wonderful.  We were seated inside, so unfortunately did not get to experience the balcony, but I really loved the atmosphere inside.  Had all the old charm of New Orleans with a bit of a modern feel.

If I ever go back to NOLA (and I hope I do!), I will be back.  The Blackened Chicken Sandwich was calling my name...",2011-05-31 14:22:39

  They had an interesting cocktail list and it was revealed to my wife that all of the cocktails were going to be pretty sweet. This wasn't too surprising since we were one block off of bourbon street.  We both decided to try one but my wife's was undrinkable. So they offered her a glass of white wine instead which was much more palatable for her.

The balsamic glaze was good however, the shrimp were very small and mushy. They also were not deveined. I asked for a side of bread and it was hard and stale. My boyfriend enjoyed the soup. We both had a Bloody Mary which was very good yet inconsistent-mine came with an olive, pickled onion, pickled green bean and celery however, my boyfriends only had a piece of celery.

We had just arrived in New Orleans and after checking in to our near by hotel, we decided to take a stroll and familiarize ourselves with the surrounding area.   We wandered down Royal St and were busy snapping pics of all the amazing architecture and unique balconies.  Royal House caught our eyes as the balcony seating was packed full of people.  Upon waking up, we were greater by a the beautiful smile from Ms Alex.  She was so sweet and personal.  I told her we just arrived from Miami and she gave us great insight on what to try and had us wait at the bar while a balcony spot opened up.  Upon being seated, we were waited on by Dominic.  He is just great, such a warm friendly personality, and a smile that's contagious.  He guided us through the menu to our delight.  We had the fried alligator, a decisions first for us both.  I had the French onion, my partner the seafood gumbo, both amazing and filling. Finally we topped it all off with their grilled oysters which come on the shell with melted Parmesan.  I never really cared for any type of oyster and was very hesitant to try these, but I can now say, I'm a full convert!  They were amazing.  The atmosphere inside is classic upscale relaxed southern.  With everything combined, the view from balcony, Alex and Dominic, and the food, we were more than satisfied.  It made our day and set the tone for a great introduction to New Orleans.

I wish I had requested to be seated upstairs with a balcony view, but it wasn't a big deal. Something I'll remember to do the next time I return! We were seated immediately upon arrival and since the table was already given to us, did not want to have to inconvenience the restaurant with the request.

Suggest asking for Tina as your waitress if possible! She was funny and entertaining with her southern sass, one of the best servers I've had in a while. It isn't often that I'll rate a review as 5 stars, but honestly there was nothing lacking in service, environment or food that night.

Food Highlights:
+Chargrilled Oysters: Concierge at the hotel I stayed at mentioned Royal House has the best chargrilled oysters in NOLA. While I cannot attest to that, I definitely could see how it is ranked as such. Fresh warm oysters topped with parmesan butter cheese, great starter to open up the stomach.
+Crab Claws: I already had my eyes set on this dish after reading reviews and seeing pictures. It exceed my expectations as I didn't know what to expect. The lemon garlic butter sauce reminds of a crab bisque consistency, but the real winner here is the crab claws themselves! These tiny succulent crab claws really soaked up the flavor of the sauce, could not get enough of them! Highly recommend this appetizer!
+Blackened Redfish (w/ Crabmeat): Tina recommended saving some of the crab claw sauce to place on top of the redfish. This was a tip she provided since an additional $4 would be charged if we ordered it with the dish. Definitely thankful for her suggestion! The sauce was exactly the thing needed to top of the dish. Fish was blackened perfectly, meat was tender and still maintained its fresh-caught flavor.

The sauce it was in was delicious we soaked up every last drop with our bread, crackers, and were scraping the bowl with our spoons to eat all of it, it was so good.  I got the oyster pasta and that was also to die for.  It was super rich a delicious, but the sauce wasn't thick at all it was perfect to dip the friend oysters in and to coat the pasta nicely, I definitely cleared my plate on that dish as well.  My mom had the seafood pasta with red sauce, and my sister had the taste of New Orleans. My mom loved her dish and my sisters was great, she said the crawfish étouffée was her favorite of the three and she could have eaten an entire bowl of that.

The seasoned cornmeal breading on the Fried Alligator was tasty enough, but the meat was tough and on the dry side.

We ordered the Blackened Shrimp and Jambalaya.  The shrimp was bland.  Not only was it not blackened, it barely had any spices or SALT.  Judging by the transluscent color, the oddly bouncey texture and lack of shrimp flavored, we think they used frozen shrimp... which was a bit shocking since shrimp is a popular local ingredient, and this is a seafood restaurant.

The jambalaya tasted ok but it was barely warmed.  We understand that it would not be made to order, but it should have been reheated to the same temperature as the shrimps that were laying on top, not the cold plate below.

The grey, wooden floor is sloped away from the building and there is not much room for movement. Iron railings keep you from tipping over the edge onto the pavement below. On the streetcorner there was a gentleman playing Coltrane tunes on his sax. Environment was set so now we were ready for some great food. 

So always follow your first mind. We were supposed to go for Po Boys. But you know how you can be so hungry you'd eat a rickety table if it was seasoned well enough? We that was us. Everything that the wait staff brought past us looked great. So we changed our minds and ordered blackened shrimp / jambalaya and Taste of New Orleans trio: crawfish etoufee, chicken / sausage gumbo and a cup of sausage jambalaya. We also ordered redfish beignets to start which were tasty. 

When our food arrived I realized I made a huge mistake. I was dissappointed because my trio had more rice than chicken, crawfish or sausage but I was  starving so I ate it. Don't get me wrong..it was alright..just not fantastic. On the other hand the redfish dish, oyster po boy and pasta Alfredo with crawfish, crab and fried oysters on top the table inside ordered looked amazing! Maybe try that and skip the gumbos.

I returned to wonderful New Orleans last week, and after much hype from myself and my friends, we anxiously returned to our favorite restaurant from last time. Holy cow. We were all severely disappointed. The hostess and waiters were rude, slow and disrespectful. The bar tenders, however, were super awesome. But again, the wait staff were appalling. Additionally the food was HORRIBLE. No one in our group was satisfied. 

I even ordered the shrimp and grits again thinking they'd be the same as last time. Boy was I wrong. The grits were deep fried in these triangle shapes. It was disgusting! The shrimp were in a sauce that was not enjoyable either. I only ate the shrimp to avoid starving. I left the restaurant overall very upset. We will not be returning. 

They do still make a mean bloody Mary though. So if you must go, head to the bar. 

ORIGINAL REVIEW FROM MARCH 2014:

I was in NOLA for Mardi Gras for my first time back in March. We stopped here for lunch on our second day and I was absolutely BLOWN away by the food. One of the BEST meals I have ever had in my life.

It was early but there was a wait, but we were fine with that so we hit the bar. I'm not a fan of bloody marys but my friends are. They all ordered one and they honestly looked amazing! They were served with all of these marinated vegetables it was practically a side salad. I gave it a try and really liked it! But I ordered one of their custom margaritas instead and was LOVING it.

We were brought upstairs when our table was ready and upon walking up I saw someone's dish that looked AMAZING. I asked the server what it was and he told me it was the Shrimp & Grits. Knew we had to order it!

We had a decent sized party and none of us had been to NOLA before so we decided to do it family style and order a bunch of different things and split it all. I got the Shrimp & Grits and the rest got some oysters, a shrimp po-boy and some etoufee. Everything really was fantastic and so was the service. But the star of the meal was definitely the shrimp and grits. I'd never had a dish like that before and I literally fell in love. We honestly wanted to return again the next day just to eat that again but decided we should do something different while we're in town for the short time.

We had a perfect experience here and I will definitely be returning. Get the Shrimp & Grits! Fabulous!",2014-07-15 16:13:18

We were going to go to ACME Oyster House but due to a private event that was happening that evening, we ended up going to Royal House (by fate? Perhaps!) ;b We didn't even need to wait! There was going to be a table for two for us or bar seating. We chose bar seating and glad we did because we ended up socializing with the bartender/oyster-preparer (Lawrence, I believe his name is) and met some people both to the right and left side of us that we had commonalities with. Lawrence was so nice and when we asked him for recommendations, he first gave us char-broiled oysters with different flavoring for each (I forgot what they're called) because he thought it would be a good starter for people who don't really eat oysters. They were definitely delicious, but we honestly wanted raw oysters so we can control the amount of spices we wanted to put on it and slurp the oysters away! ;) So we ordered a half rack of raw oysters! So good that I almost choked on one of them as I slurped it lol then we had ordered a combo plate of Jambalaya, crawfish etouffee and some other stew-like bowl that was smoked.

We were told the wait would be 20 minutes, we were seated within 10 minutes BUT waited well over an hour for our FIRST appetizer and waited an additional 10 minutes thereafter for our main dishes. As the two groups seated after us signed their checks, we sadly were eyeing their crumbs.  However, I don't believe this is the norm for this restaurant.  I think we were simply unlucky and in spite of this, our waitress Ashley was EXCELLENT.  She was professional, friendly and genuinely apologetic for the wait.  Although I feel our entire bill should have been taken care of, two drinks and an appetizer were taken off the bill. 

Here are the pros and cons to the food and restaurant itself:

Pros:
(1)  Quaint/romantic atmosphere
(2) Although we were not seated on the balcony, I highly recommend
(3) Stuffed Mushrooms - Excellent 
(4) Roasted Red Bliss Potatoes - these came as a side with our dishes and were THE BOMB 
(5) Berry Basil Cocktail - AMAZING 
(6) Shrimp 'n Grits and Rib-ey - friends commented these dishes were pretty tasty 
(7) Pecan-Crusted Mahi Mahi - very good
(8) Bloody Mary - we did not order this drink but the bartender gave us a sample of the concoction the vodka is infused with - AMAZING

Cons:
(1) Our wait but as I mentioned, I don't feel this is the restaurant's norm 
(2) Chargrilled Oysters - came out cold, they looked appetizing but we sent them back
(3) Bathroom stalls (pro is there are bathrooms upstairs) - zero room (i.e. airplane bathroom)",2015-11-07 13:45:19

After looking at some reviews, we decided to try the red fish beignets. So, in general, they were tasty. However, in our own ignorance, we didn't realize that the fish would be dusted with powdered sugar and have drizzled syrup on it. Had we known, we would have asked for that on the side, so that we could control how much sweet was on the fish. We collectively decided that we would have enjoyed it much more if it wasn't sweet. The fish was cooked really nicely and the batter wasn't too excessive.

I also had the crawfish ravioli. When we were seated, I glanced over at another table's dishes and that dish caught my eye. Crawfish sauce isn't something I see every day so I had to try it. It's a rich and hearty dish, with about 8 ravioli. Very filling and tasty. I wish I had more time there to try other things, but I'll just have to come back sometime.",2017-12-05 18:23:04

We stumbled onto this place super randomly and thought it looked awesome. There was a 45 mintue wait and we were starving after having spent all day at the fairgrounds but the atmosphere just looked too good to pass up. 

It was rocky at first, our 45 min wait turned into a 1:15 wait. I would assume it was a new host they had just kind of thrown in there an he totally skipped over our party. After we spoke with the supervisor she immediately seated us at a great table with possibly the best server ive ever had, and myself and my friends are all in the service industry in San Diego. TIM IS THE MAN. 

Granted this was all the way back in May, but I haven't been able to stop raving about this place and how great he was. A person in our group nailed it when she said ""Tim was casually on his sh*t."" Anytime it seemed like food our drinks were taking a little too long, Tim would pop by give a smile and give us a surprisingly accurate eta. Drinks were delicious and I don't even like oysters but damn they were good.

Always start with the oysters. All of them are good but I would stay away from the rockafeller.  They are tasty, but you can get those anywhere. Go with the royale and chargrilled.  Very good and not something you find elsewhere. The raw are fantastic too if you prefer those (which I do!)

Also we got some crab claws in a creamy tomato sauce. This is fantastic!  Get extra bread right away because you will want it to soak up every bit of that sauce. 


I went with the shrimp po boy. Bread was fresh, soft inside and nice crunch on outside to give texture and hold the sandwiches shape. Shrimp were fried nicely. Not heavy and oils but light and fluffy. You could go next level by using sauce from crab claw app above as condiment!

For your sides don't get the fries. French fries are the same everywhere. Get the Jumbalaya or gumbo subbed in.  They are much better and you are in New Orleans right?

It was pretty tasty, a little Crystal helped all three.

Relaxed atmosphere at the not-crowded bar on a Tuesday night, and tonight's entertainment across the street was a musician playing an electric fiddle like a demon.

We were seated in the downstairs area and greeted by a friendly woman who was eager to take our drink order. As I ordered my iced tea, I looked over to the bar area to see a man shucking fresh oysters. I love watching people shuck oysters. I guess because I love oysters, but there's also something really neat about watching someone who is really good at popping open those shells do his work. Maybe I'm odd.

Okay, onto the food. I decided on a chicken Caesar salad, thinking that this would be a good choice for a small, simple lunch. Well, the salad was HUGE and for the price I was not disappointed at all. The dressing came on the side, which I really liked and the chicken was tender and juicy.

We used every foodist app we had on both of our phones, our hotel's kitchen had already shut down, and finally the son makes a few calls, gets a lead on what's supposed to be a killer blue crab app, so off he goes, foraging through the French Quarter, manages to grab the very last two servings of this crab claw treatment from Royal House and, folks, what a score. Everything in NOLA starts with a roux, of course, and the chef who saved us had morphed his Blondie into a rich Mornay, choice herbs in his liquid, dropping in the claws last two minutes, producing a velvety, savory dish that screamed, ""This guy is a chef.""

Located in the french quarter you can expect high prices but a nice old time atmosphere when dinning here. We got here relatively early so we were seated right away. Glad we came early because this place was packed on our way out. They don't except reservations either so best advice is to arrive early. We were also lucky to be seated upstairs. I'm sure our experience would have been totally different on the first floor. The people seated close to the door were all wearing there winter jackets because they got nailed with the cold breeze every time the door opened (it was 35 degrees out).  The 1st level was also very crowded and cramped. My advice if you go here is to ask to be seated upstairs. Our waiter was very friendly and knew the menu well. If I was rating on service I would give them 5 stars. For dinner I ordered the burger. It was good but nothing special. My dad had the Po-boy sandwich and also agreed that it was good but not worth the money. When our bill came I was surprised they actually added in the gratuity. We only had a party of five and I find this practice insulting. Royal house gets two stars because of the cramped 1st floor dinning room (glad we didn't get seated there) and over priced just ok food.,2013-01-04 14:03:55

Would be the one word to describe this place.
Nice people.
Pretty good Service.
Got the creole shrimp.  Basically a shrimp soup w/ creole sauce.
Very obviously a dish that needs the shrimp pealed prior to creating the dish.  Of the (approximately 12-15) shrimp in my meal, 3 to 4 of them were not pealed.  This made the soup-like dish very difficult to enjoy while having to pull half chewed shrimp out of your mouth to complete the pealing. 

Ok, but that's about it.

1. Fresh oysters - they were fresh, clean flavor, not creamy not grimy, minimal debris from the shuck. 4/5 stars
2. Charbroiled oysters, very good. Sizzling parmesan cheese on top and garlic sauce. 5/5 stars. Would oder again
3. Alligator bites, ok nothing spectacular. No extra seasoning, kinda like dark meat chicken nuggets. Good white dipping sauce. 3/5
4. Crab claws, excellent. Fresh tasting claws, good garlic/white sauce. Asked for more bread so I could eat the sauce. Would go great on a pasta/rice/grits dish. 5/5 stars. Would order again.
5. Shrimp and grits - ehhh the ammonia/metallic taste in the shrimp ruined it all. They had 1/2 blackened shrimp that was essentially just a salt lick, and the regular shrimp was masked by the saltiness of the creole sauce. Not too much flavor in that creole sauce, just salt. The grits was ok,  not too buttery, if you want more butter then you'll need to add it. Not salty, perhaps to balance the sauce. What I ended doing was adding the crab claws sauce into part of the grits without the creole sauce. Because of the unfreshness of the ammonia-metallic tasting shrimp and overwhelming saltiness of the creole sauce I have to give it 1/5 star since the key star was the shrimp. Would not reorder. 

Overall 3/5 would come here for oysters, appetizers and drinks.

The sun had been beating down on us for a few good hours soaking up our huge appetites, but we needed a small nosh as a pick me up. We ended up choosing the crab claws and a side salad for our meals. I was a bit disappointed that the server wouldn't acknowledge our yelp coupon after we had ""checed-in."" It was a free appetizer, and apparently even though we ordered two of the crab claw appetizers he still wouldn't grant us that. Oh well....

The ambiance was just OK. I wasn't too happy with the table we had since it was situated right by the kitchen's swinging doors and servers frequently had to stop by to close the doors to the bustling kitchen. 

The food on the other hand was good. I could have had a crisper/colder salad and not room temp. But, the crab claws served with garlic toast points won me over. They were smothered in a creole buttery sauce that had me licking my fingers and plate!

The place is conveniently located in the French Quarter and it looks lively. I sat and I looked at the menu. I was looking for some local food since it was my first meal in New Orleans. I found a variety of options and I listened to the suggestions that our waiter Yamini listed. After a while I chose to try crawfish étouffée for $19. I also ordered a Voodoo juice for $11. My drink arrived first. It came in a tall glass with a black straw drowned into a blue liquid. The drink is made of rum and a variety of other ingredients. It was good but now, in retrospect, I don't think I would spend more than $6 for a drink so I would have opted for a beer or a cider if I could turn back time. My meal arrived and it consisted of a center of white rice surrounded by breaded crawfish in a crawfish stew with two small slices of bread. It was good and flavorful. I liked it. I was in New Orleans and half of my experience was about eating local food so I discovered from my girlfriend that she could get a free appetizer under $12 with her phone. By this I mean she checked in on Yelp to get the free appetizer but, honestly, she does magic with that phone a lot that it's not even funny sometimes (lol). Most of the stuff was priced above $12 but one thing was not and it was fried alligator. I decided to get that and try it (the menu says it costs $11.5). The fried alligator arrived shortly later and it consisted of breaded nuggets. Honestly, I found it surprisingly good and I really enjoyed it, probably more than the stew. It tasted like chicken nuggets but with some additional texture and a little harder. It was definitely the highlight of the night.

I had looked at the menu online and it sounded good, but when I approached the restaurant there was a guy out front shouting out menu items and trying to get customers to come in.  That made me super nervous - usually those are tourist traps and the food is horrible!  Not the case here.  

The location is great - the upstairs seating is a little bleak but some paint would change that. The outdoor patio has such a great view.  And there is AC and ceiling fans.  The downstairs is fantastic, cute and nice to sit at the bar.  

The oyster shucker/server/bartender that helped me (Jeffrey) was so friendly - offered tips about the city, what to do and what not to eat!  The oysters there were amazing.  I ordered char-grilled oysters once or twice a day - basically every restaurant that served them.  Royal House is BY FAR the best (better than a few high end restaurants and some other local 'oyster bars').  The oysters are simple - butter, parmesan, maybe some garlic, a lemon and french bread on the plate and they are boiling in the shell.  Delicious and not overdone.  

Jeffrey told me to watch out because apparently some places in the area buy oysters buy the gallon bucket and buy shells and serve them.  GROSS!  He pulled out a bag of oysters that were delivered when I was sitting there and shucked them in front of me, served me some on the half shell right there and sent more off to the kitchens to be char grilled.  That's fresh and that's service.  

I ate there twice during my trip and it was a huge mistake not eating there more.

From all the reviews and awesome pictures, I was expecting an AMAZING dinner!! I was greeted at the front by a young girl who later turned out to be my waiter. 

She was really pushy on the drinks, but extremely sweet.

I decided to go with the shrimp and grits... HORRIBLE. The plate is $16 and comes with roughly 6 pieces of shrimp and a huge plate of grits. ""Whatever"" I thought, this plate must be amazing because of the great reviews... WRONG. The grits tasted spoiled? Apparently they have some kind of cheese inside of them... Not exactly sure what kind of cheese it is but I've never tasted something like this.. ever. 

The server saw my face and asked me what was wrong, I told her and we decided to go with the crawfish ravioli ($22). Came with only 5 pieces of ravoli and what seemed like chopped vegetables sprinkled with some melted cheese on top. This wasn't bad.. but It didn't have any flavor whatsoever.. not even salty or anything.

Extremely dissapointed with this restaurant. Basically almost a $30 meal for ONE person and the quality was not good at all. My server was really nice but it seemed like she was serving half the restaurant and greeting people in the front by herself since she was all over the place.

I ordered the Taste of New Orleans: Gumbo, Crawfish Etouffe, and Jambalaya, served with more toasty bread. Each ""taste"" cup had a scoop of rice in it. The gumbo was very good, with a nice Smokey flavor from plenty of sassafras, I believe. The crawfish etoufe was very salty.

My boyfriend ordered the Shrimp Creole- shrimp in a very fresh tasting tomato sauce, served with rice. I do feel like the dishes were rather diluted with the amount of rice, a pretty cheap ingredient, even though that is part of the cuisine.

Looked over the menu and I couldn't find a dish that had everything I wanted so I decided to order the Dungeness Crab and my girlfriend got the Peel n Eat shrimp and we would share.
They were out of the damn crab :( and I'm not a fan of working hard for snow crab just to get such little meat. So I went with the peel n eat shrimp as well.
Let's just say I wasn't at all disappointed they were out of crab because the shrimp was AMAZE! Perfect flavor, perfect hint of spice, and they brought a whole lemon when I asked for extra. Bonus points!
We also shared the bananas foster cheesecake which was perfect.

This is a great stop in the quarter located on the corner of St. Louis and Royal Street.  There is a host to seat you if you want to grab a bite, but also a really long bar if you just want to saddle up and knock some back.  This place really does a good job of balancing restaurant and bar.

Our waitress was great.  Lots of personality; she checked on us frequently without interrupting our flow.  I love the way she explained the drink specials, describes not only the ingredients, but the process in which the drink is made and information about the region/origin of the beverage.  I think the extra effort set the tone for time at this watering hole.  I settled for the New Castle Summer Ale, which was great for this particularly hot day.

Pros

-The chicken burger I ordered was good
-We ordered two cocktails off the menu and both were really good!
-Our waitress was really friendly!

Cons:

-It took a really long time to get our drinks and entrees. We clocked it at taking 50 min to receive our food.
-My husband ordered a Chicken Caesar Salad that had dried chicken and way too much dressing.
-A waitress (not ours) knocked into our table by accident and dropped the condiments. Accidents happen, totally understandable, but she didn't even say sorry. She kind of just expected us to pick it up.",2016-10-29 21:38:35

We were seated at a folding  table that is identical to one at Costco.  The people seated on the end, had no room for their feet, so we asked to be moved.  The food was not good.  The fried fish and shrimp was surely frozen, as it was watery.  They were out of hushpuppies.  The bread that was under the fries was days stale.

It came out as three little thimbles of food. Fine. Was it three scrumptiously delicious thimbles? No. It was some of the worst food I've ever had in New Orleans. I also made the terrible mistake of ordering the creole shrimp. The shrimp weren't deveined and I was told that is normal. Fine. Maybe I'm just a weirdo Texan who likes her shrimp cleaned. The bigger problem is that all of the  food was severely lacking in flavor to the point of being inedible. The etouffe and gumbo both tasted the same. The jambalaya could be choked down,  but only after I doused it in salt and pepper. To add insult to injury it took about 30 minutes to get our bloody mary's (which were ok) and about an hour to get our food (on a Monday with now crowds).

A lot of places were packed but Royal house seemed like a good option and wasn't busy. We should've known better considering the location, but we were starving.

I told the waitress (who was super nice about it) and in the end just changed the entire order bc I was afraid they wouldn't make the replacement right either. The manager came out and tried to explain that it was cooked so I wouldn't worry about getting sick but I know chicken and it didn't taste right. Anyway I changed it to the shrimp platter and it was really mediocre for the $18 they charge (think Friday's type quality).

I love the vibe and feel of this place. The staff is super friendly and it's super clean and feels upscale without the upscale prices and frufi-ness. We liked the alligator po boy more than the oyster. The alligator tasted just like chicken but much more moist or fatty so we loved that.

I was craving oysters so naturally we stepped into the place advertising their oyster bar-- I am definitely glad we did. They house quite a selection of oysters and the ones we had knocked my socks off - super delish! We ordered two rounds, heh.

For the meals, we decided to see how they'd fare at traditional Cajun food. This is where the 1 star got knocked off for me, personally. My grandmother is Cajun so of course my opinion is gonna be a bit skewed but their presentation of etoufee, jambalaya, and gumbo simply didn't impress. I enjoyed the gumbo most of the 3 but overall just felt - meh. That being said, other meals might impress as much as their oyster selection but we simply didn't get the opportunity to try as we both ordered the Cajun sampler.

The etouffee is KILLER. The gravy has a great kick. My Taste of New Orleans dish left out the fried crawfish tails promised on a whole crawfish etouffee dish. If you're thinking about getting the Taste of New Orleans, just get the crawfish etouffee on it's own, as the gumbo had an odd aftertaste and my jambalaya was bland and had almost no seafood or chicken in it. Also, the bread they give you with your dish is depressingly soggy. 

The chargrilled oysters are also really tasty. The cheese surprisingly balanced well with the brininess of the oysters. Careful, the oysters are ridiculously hot when they come out. Kind of wish I found out through the waiter instead of burning my finger trying to pick up the oyster.

Get the fried alligator if you want to say you've eaten alligator. It really does taste like expensive popcorn chicken.

Overall, Royal House is a decent option if you're looking to eat close to Bourbon Street. I'm sure there are better options for each of their menu items elsewhere, but you can't beat being right in the middle of the action at French Quarters and their hours (open until 11pm or midnight)!

Famished, we stumbled in here because it was the first restaurant we came to.  My boyfriend ordered two appetizers (unfortunately cannot remember what these were, but they were seafood based) and (after learning that they were out of the poor boy that was my first choice) I ordered the Rib Eye.  The appetizers my boyfriend ordered were good, but not great.  The Rib Eye was a crime.  Paying almost $30 for a piece of meat, I expect a halfway decent steak (even if I did make the rookie mistake of ordering a steak at a seafood place).  What I received was a very thin, dry, flavorless piece of commodity meat.  Whatever it was, it wasn't like any ribeye I've ever eaten (an I have eaten a fair few), especially at that price.  As hungry as I was, I could not eat more than a few bites.  When our waitress came to clear our plates, she asked me if I wanted to take it with me.  No, I said, because clearly time was not going to improve this.  She then told me I should have it wrapped up and find a homeless person to give it to.  Look, I appreciate the thought and certainly I have given away my leftovers before, but it is inappropriate to, once I have paid a bunch of money for something I consider inedible, then put the responsibility on me a to wander around the Quarter late at night looking for someone to give it away to.  Great, just want I want after a long day of travel, to overpay for something I don't want to eat and then have to wander around trying to find a way to dispose of it.  Yup.  

Cute place, appetizers are decent, and staff is reasonably friendly.  I just wouldn't necessarily advocate getting dinner here.",2014-02-09 22:27:06

Chargrilled oysters 5/5: grilled perfectly with crunchy baked cheese on top and creamy sauce on top of oysters. Would absolutely get these again.
Raw oysters 4/5: Just about like any other raw oyster place. Nothing too special but nothing bad about it either.
Crawfish cakes 3.5/5: A nice change from the usual crab cakes. I probably wouldn't get it again and would try another appetizer instead.
Taste of New Orleans 3/5: Comes with 3 cups of Jambalaya, Seafood Gumbo and Crawfish Étouffée. The Jambalaya and Crawfish Étouffée were great, but the gumbo was a bit bitter.
Blackened redfish with crawfish sauce 4/5: The fish was cooked perfectly and seasoned really well. The crawfish sauce is extra, but I highly recommend getting it. If you're unsure you can get the sauce on the side and dip it in when you want.

The food had extremely high salt content and the flavors didn't particularly standout. My friends and I were basically all chugging water the entire time because of how salty everything was.

- Fried alligator: good -- essentially tastes like popcorn chicken.

- Stuffed mushrooms: good -- the crab and shrimp stuffing was tender and well marinated.

- Taste of New Orleans: the standout here was the crawfish etouffe. The soup was very creamy and rich. Could have been better if it had more pieces of crawfish. The jumbalaya was downright disappointing. It mostly consisted of rice, without any meat or vegetables. The flavoring was the type without tomatoes. The gumbo also tasted somewhat odd and was too heavily spiced. 

- Crawfish ravioli: probably my favorite dish out of all the ones we tasted. The pasta was well cooked and the entire dish was very creamy and cheesy.

- Shrimp creole: basically was just rice in tomato sauce -- I understand that that is what shrimp creole is, but the flavor was one-dimensional.

- Fried shrimp: honestly just so salty it was hard to eat more than a couple of piece.

Atmosphere: Rowdier and louder than I expected. The atmosphere is very casual, with a ton of TVs showing sports games. The website looks very sophisticated in comparison to the restaurant itself.

Service: Was pretty slow. First, the food took a really long time to come out, second it was hard to get ahold of our waitress for water refills or anything else.",2017-01-16 21:32:17

They had all the fixings and sauces...the way it should be served. In retrospect, we should have gotten 2 dozen :-D

The kid ordered the burger; we were both really impressed with the flavor and quality. The hamburger patty had a crust that lent to a crispy char on the outside and a perfectly medium juicy burger.  I ordered the seafood pasta in a garlic cream sauce. This dish actually is served with marinara but I figured it would overpower the fresh seafood. Loaded with clams, mussels, shrimp and crabmeat, I can't recall the last time I finished a pasta entree but I sure killed it!

In all honesty though, how does one have bad oysters except for ones that are not fresh (and that spells serious trouble)? The next most important thing is that they have tabasco + lemon to serve you. With those 3 items checked off, Royal House made the cut.

My friend and I shared the seafood combo. It was $50 and it came with a large red lobster staring lovingly back at us, clams, mussels, shrimp, and corn. The mussels were tasty. The clams were shriveled and sad and it was only my friend's keen eye that alerted us that our initial order was missing clams. Our server brought them out later. The shrimp was marinated in seafood juices and totally delicious with the shell on (trust me, eating the shell is not a sin). Though it was yummy I thought it a bit pricey for the quantity. You're in a tourist-y area, what can you expect, right?

The servers were super friendly and funny and the restaurant is located on the corner of Royal.

We lucked out with a balcony table because the couple ahead of us wanted one but didn't want to wait 15-30 minutes and so they left, literally 30 seconds after they left the spot opened up and we were taken instead! 

The balcony is really narrow so it's kind of a squeeze between seats and in the walkway and there aren't any lights so eating at night got interesting but the ambience from Royal st. made up for it, we were surrounded by music and the lights along the quarter.

YiGHddOeb7IbeIMOr0aPJQ,ke3L4ZK5UEsxWTayBlXkIA,VQcCL9PiNL_wkGf-uF3fjg,5,0,1,0,"So, on my trip to New Orleans, my coworker & I made it a point to wrap up our work on our last afternoon there, to carve out some time for Bourbon Street. We had made the walk down, scored some brewskies & were back out on the street (man, Atlanta's really gotta get an area like this) hunting for some dinner, 'cause the drinking wasn't going to get far, on empty stomachs. After checking out a few side streets from Bourbon, we came down to Royal, and saw the Royal House Oyster Bar; unlike a lot of the joints we had ambled past, this place neither had a line running down the street, nor was it deserted, which never bodes well for the food within. 

We were waved in by a friendly maître d' who welcomed both us and the milk-pail-sized beers in our mitts (again, just gotta love this town), and were taken right back to a table by the bar, with a window for people watching. My coworker went for the ""Taste of New Orleans"", which is a single plate featuring the 'holy trinity' of Louisiana cuisine, Jambalaya, Etoufee & Gumbo. All three looked pretty good, and came together to make up a pretty heavy-portioned plate of food. 

I figured, I'm in an oyster bar, heck, why not be different & go for the oysters? I love Oysters Rockefeller, and a half dozen of those got penciled in first, on my wish list. I completed my order with the Oysters Royale, & stuck with the tub of malted goodness I had brought in with me. The kitchen must have been pretty well stacked, staff-wise, because the food came out pretty quickly.

 I soon had two rock-salt-laden platters groaning under the weight of the most monstrously-mounded oyster-goodness concoctions I've ever seen. These things were piled high, folks. If you're the type who likes to get a dainty niblet of oyster with every mini-forkful of dressing, you're going to need really good knife skills. Otherwise, you're going to have to gnosh your way down to where the bivalve resides. The dressings were light & moist on the inside, a testament to delicate handling on the part of the cooks. They were baked off to delectable perfection.  The Oysters Royale struck me as a little bland, but that could perhaps be due to being enjoyed alongside the Oysters Rockefeller, which were packed with flavor. 

A side note on the Rockefellers here; they're a good deal spicier than I've had anywhere else before. I chalked that up to being in New Orleans, and still enjoyed them immensely, but if you're capsaicin-averse, you might want to consider some of the other offerings...or order a glass of milk. My dinner ended up consisting entirely of the dozen oysters, but even after handing over two for sampling purposes, I departed as stuffed as the oysters had been. Bravo, Royal House, may you enjoy a long run in the French Quarter, for I shall be back. Merci Bien.",2009-08-11 21:19:33

We then got the trio sampler, shrimp and grits and crawfish ravioli as entrees, and honestly, while they were all decently tasty (though they were out of the étouffée), the oysters and crab really dwarfed the entrees.

We watched tables come and go, and missed a show we had planned to see after dinner, because we were there waiting forever.  Our server, who was very polite, and very attentive, blamed it on the kitchen. The manager blamed it on the kitchen. Personally I think she forgot to put the order in.  Whatever the case, they said ""sorry"" and that was it.  They didn't even offer to take anything off the check or buy a round of drinks.  Oh, they also charged me full price for my app even though I had the Yelp check in special.  ""Oh we totally screwed up your night and kept you waiting 4 days for dinner? We better charge you extra!""  Since I'm not really sure what happened or who was a fault, I'm going to just leave it out, because of the food. 

The food.  Started with the crab claws. If we were seated in a dimly lit corner, I would've licked the plate. I'm not kidding.  I could eat this every day.    For dinner was the taste trio.  I opted to add the blackened shrimp to the jambalaya and I'm so glad I did. It was fantastic.  I took a quick taste before taking a pic because I was starving, and before I knew it I had eaten the entire cup.  So good. The crawfish etouffe was so flavorful with big chunks of crawfish.  I'd order a big fat bowl of this if I were ever in the Royal House again.  The gumbo was ok. It was a bit too smokey tasting for me, but my husband absolutely loved it.

4- people got the shrimps and grits and licked their plates pretty clean so I would recommend that for a New Orleans style dish. I got the crawfish étouffée- pretty good- good size portion for most entrees. Others tried the ribeye that was tasty and cooked well.

Sat on the balcony which was nice but the table was so slanted that I felt like I had to guard my food and drinks so they wouldn't slide off into the street below. The view was okay but the extra bar that was installed really hindered it.

AqF7ulHnax2sSaEHtISZlA,vndJmanpPhzKRdDztWSxDw,VQcCL9PiNL_wkGf-uF3fjg,4,2,0,0,"I came here for a late dinner around 10pm on a Thursday and was seated immediately without a wait (they close at around 11pm). I've heard that normally the wait is very long and also earlier in the day you can request to sit upstairs (tables for 2 only), which can be cool.

We got the chargrilled oysters which were soo yummy. The parmesan is perfectly baked and bubbling and taste amazing. The oysters here are also very fresh and delicious. I personally actually like ACME's chargrilled oysters a little bit more, but my boyfriend likes them better here, so it's really pretty comparable. The raw oysters were also good, and they are bigger than the ones we are used to eating back in California. They're also saltier than the ones we're used to back in the bay. We also got the crawfish cakes, which were fine. They were a bit salty and dense. I would probably have preferred a different appetizer instead.

I got the Taste of New Orleans, which was yummy. It comes with 3 cups: Jambalaya, Seafood Gumbo and Crawfish Etouffee. I didn't like the gumbo much; it had a weird, bitter aftertaste. The Jambalaya was very good. The rice was very aromatic and flavored very well and not dry at all. The Crawfish Etouffee was by far my favorite of the 3. It's super well seasoned and very tasty. If I came back I would get the etouffee with a side of Jambalaya.

My boyfriend got the blackened redfish because of the yelp reviews raving about it. If you like fish, you should get this! The fish was so flavorful and very well seasoned. I'm usually worried about fish being too dry, but this was cooked so well and was very moist.",2015-09-02 05:53:10

We were greeted at the front door. Calling us kings and queens was a bit cheesy. We were immediately sat upstairs. We sat for 10-15mins without any servers greeting us. Eventually we had to get drinks from the hostess. AND put in entre orders with the hostess. Eventually our waitress came over to greet us. It took about 25-30mins to get our food. But when it came out, my friend's plate had hair on it. So they had to take it back. 

In the mix of all this, the manager and our waitress got into an intense argument. I literally thought they were going to fight. The entire upstairs was being ran by only two servers. So I guess the waitress were not happy with the amount of people being sent upstairs. 

The food was good but overpriced. We could have gotten better food for half the price if we were outside of the French quarters.

I'll have to start with the cons:
We ordered the Oysters Trio which were a little dry. The remoulade was not my favorite.  The Jambalaya tasted like generic rice pilaf. Sadly, the Gumbo had a rubbing alcohol taste to it. 

But...for the pros:
The Crawfish Etouffée was the best item on there. And surprisingly, the Linguine and Clams were tasty -- not that New Orleans is known for their Linguine and Clams. The  Bread Pudding with ice cream was yummy and rich. And I will say we got great service. Our server was on top of it with the iced tea refills.

However, the cavalier attitudes exuded by two particular hostesses and my waitress took away from the flavorful options offered by Royal House, which was highly disappointing to say the least.

My dining experience started with two hostesses giving off an attitude as if they were doing me a favor by allowing me to eat at their restaurant despite the fact they had very few guests at the time. When I asked to sit on the balcony, they made it seem like an issue and verbally complained about having to walk me upstairs just so I could be seated. Needless to say, that rubbed me the wrong way, but I had my mind set on some fresh oysters (which are prevalent throughout New Orleans) and I had my eye focused on the potential vantage point from their balcony.

The waitress took nearly 15 minutes to approach my table to offer me a beverage. After ordering gumbo, she brought my gumbo out without a spoon. It took nearly another 15 minutes to get a spoon, which I obtained by going to the bar on my own accord. Upon acquiring my spoon, the gumbo was cold so I had it replaced.

On a positive note, the aforementioned food was spectacular. The oysters were fresh and nicely sized, the gumbo was delicious (when served warm), and my friend's catfish tasted as if it was seasoned by the hand of God.

Pros:
Oysters on the half shell,
Fried catfish,
Gumbo,
The location, and
The view from the balcony.

Cons:
The negative attitudes exhibited by some of Royal Houses' employees, 
The poor service I experienced, and 
The french fries were lackluster.

First, we got the Crab Claws for an appetizer. Easily could have ordered two as an entree. 

For the entrees we got the Seafood Pescatore and the Shrimp Creole. Each equally as good with different tastes. The only downside is that at some point, we were out of food.

We split a dozen oysters between the three of us, and they were as good as you would expect.

When we finally got seated, we were a drink or two in, and boy did things get fun fast. I ordered the taste of New Orleans, which was a decent sampler platter, but really, I should have just gotten the étouffée (I was less thrilled with the jambalaya).

For drinks, we got a Hendrick's Royal Cup (Hendrick's, Pimm's, Sprite & Cucumber). It was tasty, not too strong, and very cucumber-y.

For dessert, we ordered the bread pudding. My-oh-my, how tasty too! The bread was nice and warm, soft and had raisins. It was not too sweet either. Just the perfect little wrap-up to our meal.

After doing my homework before the trip, this place was bookmarked because they offered a ""Taste of New Orleans"" dish and the reviews here seemed excellent. So, off we went. And, just for good measure, I am going to copy/paste right from their site as it currently reads: Taste of New Orleans $18.00
A sampling of the city's most famous dishes: Chicken & Andouille Jambalaya, Crawfish Etouffée and Chicken and Andouille Gumbo.

Weird that I did that, right? Well, yeah, it is weird and so is this story. 
Sat down. Pulled up Yelp for the discount (free appetizer) and was informed that I had to buy 2 entrees if I wanted to use it. Done, no problem, we had already planned to anyway. We opted for the alligator bites and ordered some drinks while my husband worked on deciding what he wanted. Finally came time to order and I ordered the Taste of New Orleans and the waitress informed me they were out of it. So, I asked which part they were out of (thinking I could still get it and just be short one of them, which would have been cool with me) and she said, well we actually aren't out of it but we don't have the right dishes. Oh? Ok. So, I said I needed another minute to think it over. After thinking about it I asked if maybe they could just put it in the to-go containers and I would eat it that way? She said no because the manager didn't like how it looked on the table, which I totally get. SO, THEN I said, hmmm well, I think I will just get it to go and we will find a little park to eat in outside and she said no she couldn't do that because they were all out of it. After looping through the whole, ""which part?"", ""well, we have everything but we can't serve it"" routine, she basically was just like, look, this menu item is not available for purchase. LOL HUH? 

Really guys, this happened. AND THEN the alligator bites come out (which were OUTSTANDING by the way!) low and behold the dish they were served in, a little crock. Honestly, the exact thing this trio would have been served on. At this point, I knew a few things. I knew I wouldn't be giving this place any more of my business, I knew my Yelp coupon would be voided and I knew that I was beyond annoyed. SO, I did something I rarely do, asked to.....speak to the manager...it actually hurts to type it. Anyways, manager guy comes over and rude as can be and says YOU CANT ORDER IT, WE DON'T HAVE THE PROPER DISHES THEY ARE ON BACK ORDER and walks away. (LOL???????) HUH?

So. This happened. Just to clarify- the place had bowls, the place had smaller crocks, the place had plates and anything from that trio could have been ordered on it's own. I was and still am perplexed at this whole scenario. Honestly. It is not my nature to cause a stink, but I couldn't let this go for some reason, mostly because it made ZERO sense. FIND A WAY. That's it. Like seriously. Especially if the nagging customer (me) asked about it for like 15 minutes in 15 different ways! YEESH!

Last time Mother's took that title...this time it's Royal House which is sad considering it was one of my best meals the last time I was here. So either they have declined immensely or I ate a bunch of trash last time. 

There was some confusion with seating at the beginning. Once we got seated, although we were acknowledged a few times, it still took a while for the waitress to come take any orders. By the time she got to us we were ready to order. For appetizer, fried alligator (which was lit) and crab claws (I expected big ass claws and not the blue crab joints but the sauce alone redeemed the plate) which took a while to come to the table. Even tho we waited an eternity, I thought the tasty appetizers would lead the way to a tasty meal but... I was sadly mistaken.

After waiting for the Third Coming of Jesus, our meals finally arrived. Lemme start with the blackened redfish that should be advertised as Dehydrated Redfish. MakeYouChokeFish. Seasoned ok but overcooked. The veggies were undercooked and hard. The real disappointment tho is the damn Taste of New Orleans. Three small bowls of sadness and depression. No flavor at all. They must have burnt the roux in the gumbo...that was the only flavor I could get from that. Etoufee tasted like nothing, jambalaya was trash. If that was the flavors of NO then everybody needs tongueotomies...and yes I made up a word. I had them comp my meal and refused to order anything else because I would be able to cash my retirement by the time the meal would have arrived. 

What lured me in was the damn free appetizer with a Yelp check in (tryna be cheap after blowing my per diem at emeril's) and we couldn't eem use it after they comped my meal. I was in that joint mad emotional ...brink of tears. Then once we were finally able to leave this two hour ordeal, I was greeted by the Queen of cockroaches outside of their bathroom.

Our server was so lovely. She checked in on us several times and was extremely humorous. Bumped the overall experience up a star. 

The food was all around disappointing. We were only in New Orleans for one night and wanted to have a great experience with seafood and had seen great reviews via yelp. 

The crab claws had a great flavor, but was 95% sauce and 5% crab claws. The crab claws were also extremely tiny and had little to no meat. The bread was buttered but would've been much tastier slightly toasted. 

My sister ordered a crawfish ravioli which was good, but had a less than generous portion size for the price. My father and I wanted to be adventurous and try to the Alaskan crab boiler pot. 

THIS IS NOT ENOUGH FOR TWO PEOPLE AS WE WERE TOLD. The Alaskan crab boiler ""pot"" had one half of a corn, four legs of crab, and two potatoes. 

Are you kidding me? This is a boiler pot! Fill it with some more corn (this is hella cheap anyways) other than one measly half cob. Add some crawfish, some mussels, shrimp or anything to fill the emptiness of the pot. This was absurdly overpriced and just not worth it.

I had the oyster po boy and it was just okay.  I really had to douse it in hot sauce to really give it any flavor.  I was hoping for a remoulade sauce but was informed they did not have one.  My dad had the same opinion of his oyster po' boy.  They were very largly portioned and bready.  We did however both really enjoy our red beans and rice.  I could probably live off of red beans and rice though.  My sister had a shrimp po' boy and she said it had a lot more flavor.  I did find a shrimp in my oyster po' boy though (and I'm allergic!)

Little did I know that it would turn into a dining experience that should have been included in one of Dante's rings of hell.

It was very busy so I was seated at the oyster bar at about 7:45 p.m. 20 minutes go by and people all around me (including customers who arrive considerably after me) are getting drinks and food and I don't even get a menu. I flag down one of the people who look like they're in charge to tell them I have not been helped and have not even gotten a menu; he apologizes and tells me that my dinner will be comped.

Meanwhile at the bar, Kenny, who's apparently the head shucker and the only shucker authorized to take dining orders, finally takes my order. I order what I would have with the certificate anyway: a cup of seafood gumbo and the crawfish platter. He repeats it thrice to make sure he has it right and I confirm it three times. I get the gumbo in about 10 minutes and it was pretty good with sausage, crawfish, and crab that had simmered down to small threads, then nothing. 

I am there for another hour and fifteen minutes before getting the crawfish platter. Kenny doesn't realize this even though he's the one who supposed to have put in the order. He has a shucker go out for a break, never to return. I had to ask 5 times about the platter and never got a straight answer. At 15-minute intervals, I kept being told by waitresses that ""it will be right out in 5 minutes."" As the interminable wait for the entree continued. I order a beer. I was nursing the beer and finished most of two beers before the crawfish platter finally arrived with crawfish cakes, fried crawfish, and crawfish etoufee.

I was so hungry and angry that the entree tasted like cardboard to me. Apologies and lack of responsibility by the staff don't make up for that 3 hour dining disaster in my life I'll never get back. Blaming the entree tardiness on the shucker who walked out is unprofessional and wrong. It may have contributed to this but was not the cause of the problem. This is not a leisurely hours-long dining kind of place. When a business can't get it right, they should make it right and not screw it up worse by not fixing the problem and lying and making excuses on top of it. The only good part of the meal experience was the bread pudding. Afterwards, Kenny had the cajones to say that he hoped I would return to Royal House. And re-live a horrible memory?

The food was very good. We had they oyster duo app and I had an oyster po-boy for an entree. I took a star off because our table was the only table I could see that lacked any condiments on it (and our candle was never lit like the other tables.) It took almost 6 minutes to get any ketchup or hot sauce to our table and they just took it from another diners table. We were also seated in a corner of the restaurant that was not in the main area and off by ourselves. Perhaps they thought that would be nice but it was really dark and poor lit. Perhaps because of below....

I took off 2 stars because we saw a cockroach. A living, breathing cockroach. It was crawling on the chair beside us and even flew up on the table before we kicked it off and it hovered on the floor for the remainder of our meal. 

The food here was actually really good and I would have probably given this place 4-5 stars had it not been for the extra ""guest"" at our table.",2016-06-15 21:01:36

It was pretty packed, we did not have reservations but we were able to get in by about 7:15 PM just waiting 15 or 20 minutes. I have to first say that the service here really made the experience great. They were so accommodating, and we interacted with lots of different waitstaff, all were friendly, eager to help, and quite funny!

So this evening I got the crawfish étouffée and wife got the Cajun shrimp with peppers and onions in tomato base. We both really enjoyed our entrées! It was the first time I've ever had étouffée and it was scrumptious! She enjoyed her as well. We then shared a brownie al a mode for dessert. It wasn't anything super special, but it was quite tasty! It was also a good size to share post-meal.

The only downside I would say would be the crab leg appetizer. So I got really excited when I saw the free appetizer with a check in. The one appetizer that I had planned to get they were out of, and given the fact that I don't eat pork, beef, or alligator, we went with the crab legs. The flavor was great, don't get me wrong but the dish itself was a nightmare to try and navigate. The crab comes still attached to the little claws. You have to scrape it off little by little. It took my wife so long to get the crab meat off the legs, that her entrée showed up before she had finished the appetizer. Also, this method leaves a lot of crab shell fragments in the small pile of crab meat that you worked so hard to accumulate. So don't buy down too hard! Like I said, it's a good idea but the execution is a fail on this one. I'm still giving them four stars because of how amazing the rest of our food was and the service.

We chose the Taste of New Orleans, and by doing so I learned the difference between gumbo, jambalaya and of course, my introduction to étouffée. I'm not sure I've really ever had more than a bite of jambalaya or gumbo, so this was perfect for me. I didn't even know they all came with rice. 

Also, a new first, fried alligator. I didn't dig the taste of that little bit that was all fat, but I'm sure that's rare. I really, really liked it and I was quite surprised. I think the hurricane made me a wee bit more daring than usual :) You have to watch it with those hurricanes or you'll feel like you're in one later - guaranteed. 

The crab claws - wow!! Butter baby!! Heidi made sure there was extra bread on the table to sop up all the sauce...which was amazing. You know when you bite into something and the juices and the flavor...just trickle down your tongue and you don't want to chew yet...? That's what I'm talking about. 

We're are definitely going back before we leave and this time - more of the alligator, more of the claws, and all étouffée.

It has a pretty balcony on the second floor where diners can sit and enjoy the view below. Unlike some other places near Bourbon, it appears to be clean, have a nice ambience and upscale furnishings. That's all it has to offer. If you just want a drink and to sit and people watch, then it would be fine. But as a restaurant, it's horrible. Only the glass of Pinot Noir and the raw oysters we had were decent. Everything else that required cooking, was disgusting. All cooked items tasted like old food they bought at Costco. That's an insult to Costco and isn't meant to be because food bought at Costco frozen and cooked at home would have tasted 100 times better. I don't know where people get the pictures seen on Yelp because the food we received was nothing like that. I read so much about the reviews of shrimp and grits and was let down- they were ice cold. You can eat pasta cold but grits are like an oatmeal dish. When hot, good but when cold, they turn into hard putty. I had to carve a slice of the grits out to taste. I never return food and had to reject them. The staff was not surprised when I complained..it seemed they are used to getting complaints all day. They brought me replacement grits-my SAME dish back that had been heated up in the microwave. I know it was the same dish because it still had my carving in it. The heat didn't help. No flavor, disgusting and tasted like processed food. My husband got the seafood pasta dish and was not impressed. Nothing tasted fresh cooked. We never use coupons but since we had used the map on yelp to find Royal, a coupon popped up for a free dish. We were so upset with our other food, we were not going to use the free desert coupon but because we couldn't eat our other dishes, we were still hungry. We got the bread pudding with ice cream. My husband even said beforehand, at least they can't mess up ice cream. Well they did, the ice cream tasted like cheap generic old ice cream and the bread pudding was a cold tasteless mess.  If you want raw oysters, go to Acme. It's a no frills place - a dive actually but at least they have fresh real food and nice waiters for much less cost. If you wan to spend a little more money and have an amazing meal, go to Louisiana Bistro. It's a dive also but an amazing chef and every time we come to NOLA we go there because the meals are unforgettable.",2013-10-30 18:10:37

The chargrilled oysters are AMAZING.  My gf has never has an oyster of any sort and was VERY nervous about ordering them.  However, she could have eaten 50 of these.  They were of a good size and downright drowning in butter and cheese.  They were so good I can ignore the fact that they could have been cleaned a little better.

My gf got the po' boy and she loved it.  It looked freaking good, but I didn't try it.

My crawfish etouffee was so-so.  I liked the flavor, but it came out room temperature.  And the crawfish were fried for some strange reason.   Usually I won't complain about fried ANYTHING, but in this dish it didn't quite fit.

The waiter was very good and the prices were spot on as well.  The building is very cute, and we were seated right by a window so we could people watch.  All in all, a very enjoyable experience.

However, within 20 minutes I had some of the worst stomach pains I've had in quite awhile.  This resulted in....well...I'll spare you the gory details but suffice to say I owe the workers at a certain bar an apology for what I did to their bathroom.  The stomach issues lasted all through the next day.

I can't be certain that whatever got me came from Royal House (they'd get 1 star if I was certain of it), but if anyone else has this problem it would be a good thing to mention on yelp.",2014-05-11 19:53:33

Place was not busy and there were many empty tables and I was a tad disappointed that the hostess wouldn't think to give us a nicer view or even balcony table since they were open but oh well very minor thing which I wouldn't let affect my review. 

Check in on yelp you get a free appetizer. We opted for the chargrilled oysters and they didn't disappoint very yummy. My daughter ordered the shrimp po boy and since we been in NOLA we tried two different prior po boys from other places and this one was probably the least favorite. Shrimp was okay but not great. I ordered the shrimp tortellini meal and it was creamy and good - I wouldn't order again. Husband ordered the crawfish ravioli (we were in a pasta mood). Crawfish ravioli was divine. I would highly recommend it. 

We ordered hurricanes to drink - classic Nola cocktail and they were good but not too strong and didn't give you a lot for the price point. 

Server was very personable and friendly. 

Overall I think the place is good. Maybe a little too high in price for the quality received (mainly with drinks) - but then again you are in the FQ so they can get away with it. I probably wouldn't come back when in NOLA particularly because there are so many good restaurants and I want to try them all and there was no true wow factor.

I love the ambiance and the prices are reasonable for the type/caliber of restaurant. Today was the first time I had the opportunity to sit on the balcony. Great view and great food, what could be better?

I came with my mom (her first time here and NOLA) and we started with the crab claws. Hands down my favorite thing on the menu. I also got oysters. The charbroiled were the best. I'm a big oyster connoisseur so I tried two of each (Rockefeller, Royale and Charbroiled). Skip the other two and go right for Charbroiled. It's totally worth it! Last, I got an oyster po'boy BLT. Yum. The sauce is great. I added a dash of hot sauce and was a happy clam. 

Our server Billy was amazing and made us feel welcome and happy.

The only ding I'll give is my drink. I got a Makers 46 julep. It was a bit watery. Other than that, all around great lunch.",2018-05-03 01:59:28

We kept scanning the rafters and saw that Royal House had seating for two on their balcony so we ascended and were seated immediately on what ended up being a bit of a precocious creaky balcony. We were treated to the sights and sounds of Mardi Gras: there were a number of high fa-looting summer suit wearing ladies and dapper dressed gentlemen getting (including the mayor!) out of their posh rides to head over to Antoine's for krewe lunch. We witnessed the interesting politics of street entertainment where a tarot reader, a juggling act, and a five piece band were negotiating street spots and who got to set up where. And finally there were the weirdos of MG, dressed in all sorts of attire and in varying degrees of stupor at 10am. The waiter was very pleasant and chatty, just a clock-out away from full on fishing attire. Those are the highlights. We ordered a mojito, hurricane, shrimp po-boy, and a Caresse salad. My husband liked his po-boy and it was definitely sizable. My salad was okay and the mojito left a lot to be desired. For so many good places to eat in NOLA, the food here is not worth the calories.

Bottom Line: Come with your plus 1 and order some cokes to enjoy people watching from the balcony.",2012-03-06 06:28:28

Unfortunately I only put three stars because I didn't particularly enjoy my entrée, shrimp and grits. I suppose I might be a bit biased because I don't particularly enjoy grits in the first place, but  looking at other reviews made me want to try it because it seemed good. Honestly I should have known better and just have ordered something else. I was kind of disappointed because I guess I was just expecting more. The shrimp and grits wasn't horrible, but not mind blowing either. It was just alright. If anything, lots of pepper really improved the taste for me.

In addition, the hostess seated us right next to the kitchen doors. There was a weird light but pungent aroma around my table the entire time, and unfortunately I wasn't sure if it was coming from the kitchen or perhaps the body odor of some other sweaty customer nearby. I didn't really enjoy that. I wished we got seated on the balcony or those nice window side tables. I definitely should have requested another table, but at lunch time the restaurant was quite busy.

It was a trouble finding a place to park. After 30 minutes of scrambling around to find a parking spot, a saxophone player told us that there was a public parking lot (I think we paid to park) near the area. 

When we arrived to the place (late at night), we were seated by our waiter. He was very fancy-like and funny. The place was packed! On our way to our table, people left and right were slurping down oysters. We knew we had to get some, so my cousin's father decided to ordered four dozens for the entire family. 
I ordered the Alligator appetizing. It indeed tasted like popcorn-chicken, however, it has a smell to it. It was served with cocktail sauce. 

After finishing the alligator, our oysters arrived. Delicious. 

Later, my entree, Taste of New Orleans, arrived. There were three small/tall cups filled with different flavors. Two gumbos and one Jambalaya rice (?) with sausage. The orange gumbo was my favorite. It tasted very creamy... almost like butternut squash soup (heavenly). It had crawfish tails in it.  The brown gumbo, not my favorite though (even though I slurped all of it) taste kinda burnt. However, the Jambalaya and the Crawfish gumbo made up for it.

Everything, I mean everything, was slathered in at least half a stick of butter. The oysters were greasy with little flavor and lots of oyster shell bits in the sauce, the beignets weren't horrible but super sweat and just tasted like fried fish drenched in honey. The entree of the blackened redfish they forgot the crab extra in top so had to bring it out after the fact. The side veggies for this dish were again all butter and grease :( the blacked redfish was probably the best part of the meal as it wasn't too salt or greasy.

We were seated immediately at around 8pm. Our waitress said she was on her last night of training, but we felt that she did an excellent job throughout the night and had a great personality. 

We placed our drink orders from the bar after looking over the cocktail menu for a few minutes, then ordered entrees at the same time. The bar and restaurant were full, but it didn't seem overly crowded at the time. Our drinks took about 10 minutes to arrive and only seemed to be made quicker because the waitress noticed me constantly looking over my shoulder at the bar. 

My wife just ordered a bowl of gumbo, which she said was flavorful and that she enjoyed it. I had the shrimp platter, which was also good. Both of our portion sizes were larger than average, but just the right size. 

As we contemplated desert, we were told that all of the tables around us had chosen the bread pudding, so we did the same. It came out pretty quickly and it was moist and tasted fresh. 

Besides the drink order being slow, my only gripe is that I felt like we were being rushed a few times throughout our meal. The dessert menu was dropped off and explained with our entrees. After having our entrees for about 10 minutes, we were both just sitting and talking, but clearly had a good portion of food left on our plates. The waitress came by and sort of motioned for the plates and asked if we were done. Not a huge deal though. 

We both had enjoyed our dinner, so we ended up returning the next night. I had the same thing, but my wife got the blackened redfish for her entree, which she loved. We also got the redfish beignets that were recommended the night before. Those were simply amazing and neither of us could stop talking about how great they were. Definitely get those and take advantage of the free appetizer deal from Yelp if it's still going on and you're ordering 2 or more entrees. Our service didn't feel as rushed the 2nd night, but we were also there a little earlier in the evening. The drinks that we ordered from the bar were just as slow as the night before, and the bar was nearly empty this time.

1. The oysters were flavorless and not shucked properly. 
2. Our drinks came out incorrectly. 
3. Our entrees took an hour to arrive. 
4. When they did come out, they were disgusting. One of them was burnt past recognition and missing multiple ingredients--26 dollars for a literal charred piece of unrecognizable fish and some soggy vegetables is a travesty. My shrimp caprese was truly one of the most confusing dishes I've ever had--the presentation looked like a drunk child had tried to make their parents dinner, and it tasted somehow flavorless and oversalted at the same time. On top of that, there were still bits of shell on the shrimp and I accidentally swallowed it. The shrimp smelled bad and tasted old, and afterwards I threw it all up in their bathroom. My body rejected it so swiftly it was kind of impressive. The other dishes were sloppy and oversalted. It all looked like slop.
5. When we decided to ask to speak to the manager (and multiple ppl in our party are servers, so we didn't take this lightly), he took forever to come over. When he did, you could tell he didn't care at all about our legitimate concerns. He just recited a bunch of lines while looking ahead at the wall and then proceeded to take 50 dollars off of our 156 dollar bill. It was clear this happened often. 

I feel like a complete dumbass and I am desperate for other ppl who are typically smart about staying away from tourist traps to receive ample warning if they're just casually looking for somewhere last minute--DON'T GO HERE. RUN.

My wife and I visited on a recent mini-vacay trip to New Orleans and were thoroughly impressed. Everything from the friendly wait staff (a rarity in NOLA believe it or not - we encountered more rude waiters and waitresses during our trip than I could even comprehend), to the wonderful balcony seating, the presentation of the food, and the delicious flavors were well worth the price (which really wasn't too bad).

For starters, I got the french onion soup, which is one of my favorites... my wife had never had french onion soup, and really isn't a fan of onions, but she was so intrigued upon seeing the crock-full of melty mozzarella covered deliciousness that she had to have a bite. We both enjoyed it a ton and knew we were in for a good meal.

My wife ordered the fried shrimp po' boy and I ordered the shrimp and grits (we don't get fresh shrimp in Nashville, so we were on shrimp kick). This was my wife's first po' boy experience and I don't quite think she knew what to expect, and consequently found the sandwich pretty boring (not to mention a little dry), but she did say that the flavors were delicious. I had a bite and it did not disappoint. Plenty of shrimp flavor, and a dash of hot sauce mellowed out by the crusty white roll. 

The shrimp and grits, on the other hand, were anything BUT boring!! It was absolutely fantastic. First, they don't do shrimp poured over a bowl of grits like you'd expect, but instead they prep the grits and then form them into grit cakes and FRY them to a delicious golden brown. It was probably one of the more unique preparations of shrimp and grits that I have ever had. No kidding - if you go to Royal House, this is a must-try. The shrimp was prepared in a tangy tomato cream sauce and topped with a little bit of grated parmesan. It had so many layers of texture and flavor - the little bit of chew from the shrimp, the crunchiness from the outside of the grit cake, and the creaminess of the cheesy grit goodness inside. 

We finished off the night with the bananas foster cheesecake, which was outstanding in it's simplicity, but HUGE in its flavors. What else is there to say? Creamy cheesecake filling with what I think was a ginger snap crust, and caramelized bananas - all covered in a delicious caramel sauce. Can't ask for a much better way to end the night.

All in all, do yourself a favor and check this place out. It's got a great twist on some of the classic New Orleans fare, and I guarantee that you won't leave disappointed. If my wife and I get to go back to NOLA any time soon, you better bet we will be back at Royal House!",2016-06-03 18:13:20

Stick with the Crawfish Étouffée. I also tried the Fried Alligator which tastes a lot like chicken but with a different texture. It's almost silky. I thought the batter was way salty though.

Mind you, they were super friendly.   We were seated quickly upstairs, only a couple other tables who had a separate waitress.  Hurricanes were terrific, had the crab claws that were excellent as well and even used the Yelp coupon for the free appetizer.  Drinks were really slow.  Ordered oysters which were good but nothing special.  Unfortunately, my son specifically ordered no cheese on his burger, and it came with cheese so it had to be remade.  His meal came after most of us were finished.  Some other items were missing.  After the oysters were brought out, we mentioned to the young man who brought out the food that we were still missing one set.  He told our waitress that we were short a dozen and she blew it off saying that those just take a little longer.  It was pretty obvious that she had actually forgotten them and lied to us.  They came out after our entire party had finished eating.  Again, they were not busy, there were only one or two other couples on our floor with a different waitress.   No one ever offered to take the ridiculously late food off our tab.  Food pretty good, service super friendly but not good as far as accuracy and attention, should have taken extremely late items off tab.

A friend wanted oysters.  It was the closest to my place in the quarter.  So we, as walruses and carpenters, jaunted on our merry way.  They offer many types of oyster options.  We were on a time crunch, so we went raw and salads with wine.  The service was average.  Our server knew the food well enough, but did not really suggest matching wines.  The house chardonnay was aggressive and austere.  The rose on the other hand was decent and the sweet red I had was of similar standing.  The oysters were fine.",2013-07-17 17:59:41

Me and my travelling companion Speculos Beamos were greeted at the door and whisked away gallantly to our table where we were greeted by our wonderful server Jeremiah Jambalaya. He was dressed incredibly well and was very polite and charming. He guided us through the menu and I decided to start off with a salad and water. My friend started with a coke and an empty plate (I don't know what his problem was that night, seriously he should have left his issues at the door. I didn't want him to ruin my night) 

The salad was impeccable and onto my main where I had jambalaya and my friend had gumbo. The moment the gumbo touched my friend's lips a smile came to his face that I have never seen since. He said it reminded him of his younger brother Gumbo who drowned in the Mississippi and he often he wished it was the other brother that no one liked. 

Jeremiah brought my chocolate cake, which was an exquisite way to finish the night as my friend watched. Jeremiah dropped off the bill and asked my companion ""Would you like some more coke, boss?"" My friend smiled and said yes with a tear in his eye. 

The bill was cheaper than I thought it would be, especially for such a refined and cultured establishment.

We got there around 7:30pm from what I remember and we put our name down on the wait list. The wait was about 45 minutes-1 hour but it wasn't too bad since there was like a marching band coming by so we had something to watch while waiting. It gets pretty crowded by Royal Street neighborhood with all the entertainment by the street performers. 
We got seated next to the bar. We ordered dozen oysters (small), stuffed mushrooms, jambalaya, and some meat ball spaghetti. The dozen oysters were tiny but they tasted super fresh. The lemon and the sauce gives it a crisp taste. The stuffed mushrooms was also one of my favorite. The mushroom was baked and had some crab and shrimp stuffing in them which tasted so amazing! We also ordered the Taste of New Orleans which had three different dishes. It came in three small bowls and one had chicken & andouille jambalaya, crawfish etouffee and the other one was andouille gumbo. Out of the three my favorite was the crawfish.

Also, folks go out here to smoke. Hence some ash trays.

The chopped chicken salad I bought was completely wilted, and saturated with far too much of what was clearly a bottled dressing, but I powered through because I paid like $13 for it.

My husband and I are visiting New Orleans for our tenth anniversary and for our first night really wanted a casual but good, Cajun/creole meal. Royal House absolutely did not disappoint. We arrived around 5:30 on a Saturday night and there was a line to get in. We were originally told it would be a twenty minute wait, but it was more like five minutes. We checked in on Yelp and received a free appetizer; hubby chose the fried alligator bites and I chose the crab claws. The alligator bites were good but not mind-blowing. The tarter sauce tasted homemade and was better than a typical tarter sauce. The star of the entire dinner were the crab claws. I cannot begin to describe how unbelievable the sauce was. The crab claws were small and more of a second thought to the bread and sauce! We ended up dipping everything we could in that sauce! I've never tasted anything like it in my life! It is filled with spice but is in no way spicy. For dinner hubby went with blackened shrimp & jambalaya and I chose the crawfish ravioli. The ravioli was definitely good, but I probably would have liked one of their other offerings better. Nothing was wrong with it-it tasted very fresh, and it's very possible that after my amazing appetizer nothing would ever taste good enough again! My hubby's dish was in my opinion much better than mine (so happy we almost always split all food 50/50 when in restaurants!). Shrimp were well cooked, fresh, and they definitely give you a large portion of them. They don't scrimp on the sausage either, and the chicken was white meat and shredded which we liked. The flavor was spot on, and we thoroughly enjoyed all the food we ordered. (Hubby really liked my ravioli). Portions were good for us-we were filled but not stuffed, with no leftovers. 
As far as service goes, our waiter (I forget his name) was very friendly and helpful regarding the menu, and we got drinks immediately; our appetizers took a little longer than I would have liked, but being as packed as they were I can understand that. Our dinner came out literally as we took our last bite of our appetizer, and he was very quick when it came to bringing the check. I absolutely recommend this place-New Orleans has so many places we want to try but it will be very hard not to go back to the Royal House. Another interesting thing: we were seated upstairs and weddings would go by every 10-15 minutes, and everyone would leave their table to go out on the balcony to cheer on the couple. Definitely a great casual vibe. I only gave it 4 stars because it was our first dinner here; I may change it to five after we sample more of what NOLA has to offer!",2017-11-12 15:49:28

Decor-brick walls and interesting art. Couple big screens to watch the game. 

Service-FANTASTIC! Renelle was super knowledgeable about the menu and was always ready to make recommendations. She was very nice and attentive. 

Food-very good, and fresh tasting. Charbroiled oysters were seasoned with garlic and Parmesan, I sprinted lemon on top gave them just the right balance. Egg plant and fried oyster entree was very very good. This was waitress recommendation and I'm glad I ordered it. Foster cheesecake was just the right way to end night.

Chargrilled oysters do not even compare to Acme's. They were small and littered with shell. BLT-O was sub-par at best and small for price. Fries it came with were terrible. Alligator was really good. Drinks were overpriced and too heavily seasoned. Manager looking guy looked like a slob and when we asked him to clear some plates from our table he was obviously not happy with having to do it (we literally had to stack our plates on top of each other when our entrees came and no one stopped to take empty app dishes). Fried fish platter was meh. Coleslaw was terrible and there were so many of their awful fries. Fish was decent. Hardly crispy as advertised though. This was my biggest regret on my trip to New Orleans and when I was only staying for 2 nights I was extremely upset to have wasted any time and money here. Our waitress was decent and decor was nice but not worth the $100 or the hour spent here.,2014-07-02 16:58:12

We chose to be seated on the balcony, which we knew would be a bit skewed. The balcony here leans out quite a bit. FYI.

We're a bit torn as to what to write here. The service was attentive and friendly, but we ordered an appetizer that never arrived. That's odd. My wife had the shrimp tortellini and I have the blackened shrimp jambalaya. I found the jambalaya tasty, but the shrimp were a tad on the scarce side. My wife thought her dish was tasty, but thought she could order it anywhere and get the same thing. I guess we were expecting more.

So, while nothing was bad - food, atmosphere or service - I think we are perhaps spoiled by the many other great places we've eaten in New Orleans. I also recommend that you not do what we did: we went to a oyster house and didn't eat oysters (that was the appetizer we never got).",2015-04-08 12:46:21

If you're touring the French Quarter, Royal House is a likely stop by many to rest their feet and enjoy a good meal. The area is charming, it's a tourist ""must try"", and their location is ideal.The staff was friendly and nice, and the wait time to be seated was reasonable (20 mins for a party of 5 at 9pm). They have a menu that is sure to make most tourists happy (seafood! cajun! creole!) So why three stars?

When we vacation, we let loose. Food is always the focus of our trips, and we love trying local fare. Where Royal house fell short was with the food. My seafood pasta was just OK, with the seafood slightly overcooked and the sauce was very salty for my taste (as I found with a lot of the food in NOLA overall) for the price of $22, I considered it more of a ""meh"". My friends only had a few days in NOLA so they got the sampler (jambalaya, gumbo, and etouffee) to maximize delicious food. I hate to say it, but the three things they tried tasted like I could have made them from a boxed kit.

Overall, the food was just really blah, so I would not come back here on a 4 day trip that I am trying to eat all of NOLA and cram 6 meals into each day! Perhaps a stop at the bar for a drink would be a better way to take break from walking and still enjoy the atmosphere here.",2016-11-01 19:14:21

I could feel my arteries clogging as I feasted on the Crawfish Etouffée, which seemed like a good idea but the gravy was lumpy, congealed fat which must have lingered in the back of their walk in refrigerator for over a week before reaching my plate.  

On the bright side, I did enjoy the beignets.  They were deep-fried to perfection and lightly dusted with powdered sugar.  The wait staff was delightful and filled to brim with that swampy charm I came to expect in the French Quarter.  I will not name names as that would be immature and unjustified.

This Oyster Bar, Royal House for short, seemly tiny and insufficient spacing at first, giving you a sense of constant full house if they fill up the bar and window seats; looking closer,  you will see that it stands at the busiest corner at Royal St and Burbon St, and you can find plenty more tables hiding away in the back, and also the balcony if you are fortunate.

Let's get right down to the salty and slimy, shall we? Of course I'm talking about the oysters. They are not bad at all, though I wished they can take a few more moments to let the shell rinse off a bit more. At least when you get them on half-shelves, fresh or  charbroiled, they are equally tasty. If you cannot decide, try the trio of Rockefeller, Royal, and Pepperino then.

Another group of 8-10 girls was seated nearby about 10 minutes after us. That group was promptly greeted and served bread while our server sat down some packaged saltine crackers (I guess because we ordered oysters). About an hour into us sitting down I asked if we were going to get bread to which I was told that they couldn't give us any because they didn't have enough to serve with entrees. Our food eventually came out, 5 out of the 8 dishes were completely cold and 1 of the 8 dishes was missing entirely. Also, the bread that they were ""saving"" for our entrees was as thick as a tortilla. They took the cold food back to be reheated after we complained. 

While waiting for food for a second time, our server asked if we wanted another round of drinks. One of the girls said ""I want something strong, I'll get an old fashioned"".

The sausage and beans were alright, wish I got the crawfish ravioli though..

The staff was young, but excellent. She gave great recommendation that wasn't always at the top of the price point. 

We had a sort of ""off the menu"" item which was instead of the Oyster Duo where you can have oyster two different styles, the server was nice enough to let us have the three option of the chargrilled, rockefeller and royale. They were all great, but I still prefer the good ol' raw, cocktail sauce and spritz of lemon. 

We also had the crab claws was buttery, lemony goodness! They were tiny, these aren't your typical dungeness and expect to work for your seafood a little. Tots' worth it.

French onion soup was on point. Nice thick crust of cheese and plentiful on the large, sliced onions. 

Seafood Pescatore was also very good.

Our waitress was incredibly nice and personable. She had no idea what Old Bay was when I took a chance and asked if they had any for the corn and crab bisque, but brought out some cajun seasoning that helped the bisque. The bisque was more corn than crab, but it was pretty good.

The fried catfish platter was ridiculously large, like, could've easily fed two people large. The catfish itself was really good. The hush puppies that came with it were also really good, but I wasn't expecting the jalapenos in them and that was sort of an unpleasant, spicy surprise.

We selected the crab claws which were totally life changing. The other Brett said the same thing and he was right! I'll have to select useful for him. ;) the sauce was amazing and sooo flavorful. They toast some sliced baguette for you to sop up the sauce. Be careful of the little crab claws because they are very crunchy and might break a tooth. Tip: Only eat the tiny bit of claw meat on eat one. 

For the entrée, the waiter recommended several options. I appreciated his friendliness and willingness to explain different options. I almost always ask their opinions. 

I ordered the combo platter which was some gumbo, crayfish, and andouille sausage. Each one came in a separate small bowl. 3 total. Each with a tons of rice and very little meat. I loved the gumbo and the crayfish étouffée but not so much the other.

The bar tender could have cared less about my existence.

Then the dish I had ordered, ten minutes later after ordering, I was told was sold out.  The bartender said she'd give me a free drink on the house.  So I point to a bottle of red wine against the wall behind her.  She pours the remains in to the glass, and while trying to block my view, grabs another bottle of red wine to finish filling up the glass.  I sat there and drank a glass of mixed wine and wondered how many other bartenders and waitresses/waiters pull this trick off.
The dinner alas came -not exactly what I ordered, with overcooked vegetables, almost grey in appearance with cracks in the carrots (?).  The fried seafood which quickly got cold, only allowed me to taste the thick fried breading -not the fish.

We started with crab claws in garlic butter. Very tasty, with plenty of French bread for mopping up the sauce. We got $10 for an app for checking in, so they were practically free. A nice aperitif instead of the cocktails we aren't having ;)

We followed with a shrimp po boy and crawfish ravioli. The po boy was ok, a bit dry, but to be fair I am not really sure what constitutes a good one. Seemed to come out of the kitchen pretty quick so maybe it is assembly line food.  The ravioli was good. It was stuffed with ricotta and topped with a crawfish sauce which really tasted of the ""holy trinity"". I am a newcomer to Creole food, and was pleased with this choice. Not overly seasoned but schmecks nonetheless.

The specialty of the house is oysters, but I am not a oyster lover so I can't speak to that. Nice atmosphere, away from the lunacy of Bourbon St. I would eat here again and a) bring my ID, and b) try something different on the menu.",2017-01-06 22:56:49

1st stop on our Nola trip and I rank it 3rd best out of all the oysters we had. The chargrilled oysters were big and seasoned but just not hot enough. 

The service will always be memorable. We had a local nawlins waitress who was super energetic and her accent was cute. The only upset was that she hyped the French Onion soup to be ""the best in town"" but it tasted pretty regular in my opinion. That soup was super hot and cheesy though.

First, the restaurant did not seem clean from the moment we sat down, when there were flies on the table, which was set but did not seem like it had had a good cleaning before being set. Yes, the doors were open and it was warm, but this had been the case at other restaurants we visited this week as well, without flies and a generally dirty vibe. I also ended up asking for a new wine glass, as mine was noticeably dirty (something I do very rarely). We had a couple of appetizers at our table, the fried alligator and seafood stuffed mushrooms, both of which were fine but nothing outstanding. I ordered the shrimp caprese salad, in part because it was the only menu item with the Eat Fit NOLA stamp. Even though the server confirmed my order twice during ordering, the wrong dish was brought to the table. In fairness, they brought me the correct dish quickly, and removed the charge for the dish from our bill. My food was great, but my fellow diners' dishes did not look appetizing, and I'd be hard-pressed to recommend a place where I would only want to order one dish.

Atmosphere was fun considering we had a balcony seating, but if you want fresh, tasty, flavorful food, pric you will be unhappy here.  Cocktail selection is also uninspired-a bunch of overly sweet concoctions without imagination.   It is overpriced for what it is.  
We had the chargrilled oysters...fishy even though this is supposed to be an oyster bar.  Smothered in butter and cheese, they still weren't really edible.  Plus, it took a good 20-30 minutes for them to come out.  
Next the tomato mozzarella salad-tomatoes lacked any flavor, cheese nothing to write home about, and balsamic just average.  
Entree was Taste of New Orleans. Could just call it cafeteria plate. Bad flavor except for the jambalaya. Rest of cafeteria style bowls again not edible. So many other restaurants rated below this one would be a better bet.",2015-02-08 13:11:18

We ordered the stuffed mushrooms and two orders of oysters. The raw oysters were great and the fixings were perfect. On the other hand, the charbroiled oysters did not wow us and were too heavy on the creamy sauce type of topping they were served with.

1) We requested sitting on a balcony, which we waited 10 minutes for. However, while sitting there for 15 minutes, I noticed a very sickening odor, then realized it was gas (the kind from a stove). We were allowed to move inside, but surprisingly even though they said it could have been a burner that burnt out, they sat others there too. Health hazard folks.

2) Received 2 glasses of water, no utensils. Asked our waitress for them, and never got them. 

3) We had ordered, appetizer and meals. Several other tables seated after us had already been served before we received our appetizer. It finally came, and we didn't understand why others (seated after us) received their meals before we even got our appetizer. We stressed that we did not want our meals served until after we finished. 

4) Guess what? Within 2 minutes, a guy comes out with our dishes, and we told him no, we just got our appetizer. With a smug look he circled around, thinking we would accept these. 

5) We requested to speak to a manager. At this point, I could care less if he was going to give us a free dinner, I was so angry, I would never eat here. 

Shame hotel confirmed my initial thought that it was a good place to go. The food may (who knows) be good, but the service ranks among the 10 worst that I have ever had. I would never return here.

So far this week, crawfish, po boys, hand grenades, and one I didn't even know I wanted to try until I had it alligator.

After looking for a new place to try on my third day out and about I yelped some recommendations and settled on the Royal House. 

A short walk from my hotel and located at the corner of 441 Royal, the place is simply amazing. I'm glad I came in the off season when the lines aren't actually around the corner. You have to check them out.",2015-10-28 21:26:08

- You know when you go to your friends house and their grandma or mama fix you some nasty food? The fact that she takes care of you and makes you feel loved makes the food so much better. In this case, the food wasn't nasty and the service feels like you're at your friends grandmas getting taken care of. True definition of southern hospitality. 

Food that we ordered:
Crab claw = 5 stars. 
This was the first food we got to try as soon as we landed in Nola. We somewhat regretted it as it raised the bar way too high and it made our entrees less satisfactory. This was also our servers recommendation. Definitely something you have to try when you're here. 

Charboiled Oysters = 5 stars
This was out second dish and it once again raised the bar. The garlic, Cajun, buttery creole crack on that oysters were to die for. 

Gator Po boy = 2 stars
Maybe the fact that our palate got way too spoiled in the beginning that's why I'm being kinda harsh on this. The meat was so dry and overpowered with breading. Tasted like chicken nuggets.

Oyster Po Boy = 2 stars
Nothing exciting.. 

Jambalaya = 3 stars

My fiancée and I decided to eat at Royal House while on vacation in NOLA. 
Enter Chef NiRobi who's purpose on this earth is to create great food for patrons such as ourselves. In the midst of small talk between myself and the chef NiRobi I explained to him my history of dining and playing it safe on most decisions. He explained that I cannot continue with this way of thinking and asked me if I had ever tried oysters?  I explained to him that due to my 'assumption' that oysters were all slimy in texture I stayed away from them. 
He decided to crack one open right in front of me, explained that the slime from afar was nothing but water. He then placed on a cracker and added cocktail sauce and told me try. At that very moment of taking a couple of bites I was beside myself for passing up this experience in prior dining experiences. Chef NiRobi was very detailed in explaining why the combination of the cracker and cocktail sauce was the best way of trying oysters for the first time!  Obviously my fiancée was pleased with this as well since it meant we would eat other foods!
So after his wonderful advice we followed another suggestion of his where he explained that during the day in NOLA one should eat appetizers only and save entrees for when you are ready to go to sleep (since the food is so rich). Upon his advice the Mrs and I ordered fried alligator, charbroiled oysters with Parmesan cheese, and deep fried red fish in a sweet batter similar to beignets. OMG!!!!!!!!! Everything was delicious. Preparation superb! NOLA spices and flavor self evident.

As a matter of fact the only thing that didn't hit five stars were the eggplant fries but maybe it was just because they were drown out by how awesome everything else was.

Saturday night I came back for a romantic balcony dinner. The view was beautiful and you could really soak the city in from a great vantage point.

After spending all day at Jazz Fest we were short on time before going to another show so we didn't get a chance to eat. By the time we left the show it was closing in on midnight. New Orleans is not like Manhattan where dinner time is somewhere between 9 and 10 o'clock and resturants continue to serve late into the night . Things were starting to close and Sara and I were worried about quality places to eat. 

We had walked by Royal House several times before on our walks around town but usually had other places to go. Famished and delirious, (not really) we walk to the front door and ask in our best David Copperfield orphan voices if they were serving. The young man at the door noticed our plight and in the most nonchalant way I've ever heard, as if we asked him if he had bubble gum, ""Sure"".

Leading us to a table along the street side of the restaurant we were seated in listening distance and visual view of a street performer playing Rolling Stones covers with lots of audience participation. It actually sounded pretty good and was entertaining to watch. Our waiter, Tim (the kind soul who seated us), brought out our menus and asked how we were and what kind of shananagins we had been up to. After some short banter he got to the specials and was very pleasant to talk to. 

Once we ordered our food came out really quickly. I got the fried clams with pasta which was awesome. Not only cause I really hadn't eaten all day but because it was so flavorful. Everything was fresh not just the clams but the sauce as well. I wish I could remember what Sara got but I do remember it being very good. Tim was attentive and when there was time even chatted with us for a few minutes. 

We really enjoyed ourselves and even though we were stuffed and exhausted from the day we wished to stay, but it was obvious that they were finally getting ready to close. When I come back to NOLA I will defiantly stop by here again and try some more of what they have to offer. Have to say was the best meal I had in my stay.",2012-05-15 01:25:44

Luckily for us, we got the double seats in the balcony on the most beautiful evening. There was a violinist playing music along Royal Street which made the experience much more romantic.

For appetizers we ordered the crab claws and half a dozen of chargrilled oysters. We ordered the redfish and crawfish étouffée as entrees. Note that you get $10 off an appetizer when you purchase two entrees and check-in on Yelp! Yay, I love discounts! 

The chargrilled oysters was absolutely delicious. I love that despite all the butter and cheese you can still taste the oyster itself unlike other places that serve chargrilled oysters. The oysters were plump and not overly salty. The crab claws was another winner! The sauce was absolute bliss. We kept swooping up that sauce with the bread. Yummaayy...

The redfish entree was recommended by our waiter and it was definitely different and somewhat of a ""healthy"" alternative or break from all that shellfish. It was very tasty with bold cajun flavors. Unfortunately it tastes almost exactly like something I made at home before so I wasn't exactly blown away by its uniqueness. Nonetheless it was delicious. The sauce of the crawfish étouffée was pretty good but much lighter in seafood taste than I had expected. I wasn't crazy about the crawfish being fried like that because not only were the crawfish small enough, but the batter was quite plain therefore those little nuggets just taste like your typical fried stuff.

I ordered the Baked Seafood Tortellini and it was AMAZING. I'm not sure why but I was honestly surprised with how good this dish was. The only mistake I made was that this was the first meal I had in NOLA and, while I ate some delicious food during my time there, it never compared to this Tortellini.

My girlfriend had the Crawi sh & Crabmeat Ravioli and, from all reports, she was almost as impressed with hers as I was with mine. 

We sat out on the balcony for our meal and, if you have the option, I would suggest sitting inside. It was nice to dine outside but there is a very noticeable lean to the balcony and it can be off putting.",2011-11-15 04:18:41

Our waitress was extremely helpful in answering questions and giving her recommendations for our seafood beginner at the table.

The only slight blemish on the experience was when my fiancee ordered her cocktail. I can't remember the exact name of it but it had gin, sprite and cucumber in it. When the drink was delivered, it had a pretty good brown tint to it like either coke was used or whiskey. I asked about it to make sure it was the right drink which they said it was. My thought process was ""Gin is clear....sprite is clear...then why is this drink brown?"" The bartender asked if it tasted fine, which it did.

2 of us ordered the Taste of New Orleans, one ordered steak, and 3 people ordered some sort of pasta (ravioli, linguine, etc.). We waited an obscene amount of time for our food to come out. By the time our food came out, there was only one table left with people still eating in the dining room. Our server was never around to keep us updated. 

Once the food came out, the steak dish was cold. My friend didn't eat it. The 2 Taste of New Orleans were  lukewarm and not quite as tasty as other bites we have had around the city. The 3 pasta dishes were the only items that anyone enjoyed. 

The pasta and the charbroiled oysters gives this place 2 stars. But the horrible customer service and cold food is why this place isn't rated higher. We won't be coming back here. There are too many better restaurants in New Orleans to give them another chance.",2015-04-09 19:32:25

This is my second time eating oysters and I certainly was not disappointed. I ordered the half dozen; each oyster was extra meaty and fresh! It was also my second time trying alligator meat. The alligator is served as an appetizer with marinara sauce and tartar sauce. If you have never eaten alligator before, I would describe the taste and texture as a cross between a fish and chicken.

We were seated upstairs - it was a pretty busy evening though I don't think there were any lines. The bf ordered a gumbo for a soup and I also ordered two appetisers - the crab claws and the chargrilled oysters. The crab claws were amazing!! I really enjoyed this dish. I'm not sure what they put in that sauce, but I was addicted! As for the gumbo and the chargrilled oysters - these were average and nothing to write home about. In addition, it took a while for us to track down a spoon to use to eat the gumbo as we didn't get one. In the end, I ended up asking the bar tender at the upstairs bar for a spare spoon as our server was no where to be found. 

As for mains, I ordered their Taste of New Orleans - I had plenty of gumbo during my stay but no jambalaya or étouffée. Again, I would say this was average. I had eaten better gumbo and nothing about the jambalaya or the étouffée was outstanding. The bf ordered the red beans dish - he said it was alright.

Overall, we left our dinner at Royal House both agreeing that we had eaten at better places during our stay in NOLA. Someone once said that NOLA restaurants are generally known for one thing that they do exceptionally, and everything else on the menu is just average. I would agree with that in Royal House's case.

My husband and I were so tired at the end of our weekend stay so we stopped by here. They sat us upstairs on the balcony seating it's so cute up there. It's a crooked balcony though so it is a little hard when it comes to eating and keeping your food straight. But it's so cute. We ordered the char boiled oyster. Yes they are as amazing as the reviews prior to mine suggests. We both agreed that we would go back one day for the oysters alone before we even got our food!! Our main course was okay. The crawfish ravioli had some shell in it from the crawfish. But the oysters were amazing. The service was okay..we were seated quickly however after that we didn't see our waiter for 30 minutes at least not at our table. The couple that came the same time as we did we got seated the same time and they got menus, ordered and got drinks all before we even got a look. We had to go find her to place our order after looking on the online menu after those 30 minutes. Even after ordering it took a while to get our food and then after eating we waited 15 minutes to get out check finally we just got up and paid for our meal at the front. The oysters were good but honestly it's service needs a little help..",2017-02-26 21:18:08

-  Chargrilled oyster was mediocre (do yourself a favor and try Felix).  The ones at Felix was more charred and flavorful.  We thought we can have the same taste again and was massively disappointed.
- Alaskan crab legs boil pot were just snow crab legs and they charged $30 for them.  How misleading to include the word ""Alaskan"".  The seafood boil was dry!  What kind of boil is that?!

The view is lovely even if the titled angle of the balcony is a little jarring when you first get up there. 

When it comes to the actual food, though, it's another story. I ordered French onion soup as my appetizer and a shrimp po'boy as my main dish with a side of garlic mashed potatoes. My boyfriend got his gumbo, but my soup still had not come by the time the entrees came out. I was assured several times by our waiter that the soup would be out any minute. When it came time to eat the po'boy, I took one bite and immediately knew it was not fresh. The bread was harder than i was expecting and tasted almost stale, which would have been excusable if the shrimp itself had been hot and tasted good. Alas, the shrimp wasn't even lukewarm, and it tasted as if it had been sitting under a lamp or something for quite awhile. The potatoes were good and flavorful, but definitely not hot. I ended up sending back the dish. 

Finally, after my boyfriend finished ALL of his food, my French onion soup arrived. I have to say, this actually salvaged the meal for me. It was possibly the best French onion soup I've ever had, with mouth-watering cheese that was crispy in all the right places and a really flavorful broth. The waiter was very accommodating and removed both an appetizer and my main dish from the bill.

Arrow greeted me at the door and he is terrific. Some other restaurant should hire him away because he is the kind of hard-working, jovial employee that makes customers want to come back. He even mentioned the bathroom location when seating me - a very nice touch. If only the food was worthy.

I ordered the Taste of New Orleans: Chicken & Andouille Jambalaya, Crawfish Etouffée and Chicken and Andouille Gumbo. I was flying home later that day and wanted one last taste.

The Jambalaya was more like dirty rice than Jambalaya. It was also dry.

The Gumbo was okay, nothing special.

The Etouffee had a tomato soup like base. It was so bad I couldn't eat it.

The etouffee started out tasty but was a little sour a few bites in. Mentioned it to the server, who brought it up with the manager.

jrRawP2tecegoOTbdgjKsg,15tj0bkPCpweHiOjj-90NQ,VQcCL9PiNL_wkGf-uF3fjg,1,0,0,0,"I had a pretty awful experience for dinner at Royal House. I want to include all the details, so I apologize for the length of this review. It started off right. Our server, Danny, was personable and had great recommendations for the table. We had entered the place ready to enjoy ourselves, and he was delivering a great experience. Everyone in my party was there for the seafood, and I had called ahead to ensure they would be able to make one of their dishes vegetarian. I am always a little wary of places being understanding about dietary restrictions. My restriction is not a casual preference, but a deep religious belief, and respect of additional questions I have is very important. The host who answered when I called volunteered that one of the dishes I was looking at was fried in the same oil as meat, so Royal House seemed to be one of the establishments that respected restrictions. My experience when I received my food, however, was very different.

The appetizers we had were all decent. When the entrees came out, the food runner put mine down and mentioned oysters. I asked if there were oysters in the dish, since I had ordered without. He said he didn't know, he just ran the food, and that was the name of the dish. Fair enough. I asked if our server or someone else would be available to confirm. He then got defensive and said he was just someone who brought the food, and how was he supposed to know what was in my dish? If the server had put a note in, I would be fine. I know from experience that notes are often missed in busy kitchens. It is much better for me to confirm then have a surprise reaction to my dish. After a few minutes back and forth asking to speak with someone who would know, he told me that the dish actually didn't have oysters. The oysters would be on top. At this point, I needed to be certain there hadn't been a mixup. This is where things really went downhill with disrespectful service.

Danny had been busy and I couldn't find him, so I asked the hostess if she could confirm with the kitchen. The manager on duty that night came to address me, and immediately approached the conversation as if I were being unreasonable. She told me that she apologized that the food runner called my dish by its name, which included oysters, but the oysters would be on top of my dish so there were no oysters in the dish. I said I understood, but I really wanted her to check with the kitchen and confirm the dish, as made, was 100% vegetarian. Kitchens add animal fats, Worcestershire sauce, oyster sauce, and other ingredients all the time. She told me she didn't need to check with the kitchen because she had worked in the kitchen, and the oysters would have been on top. This was reiterated to my four times. Each time, the manager refused to check with the kitchen. I believe the manager's name was Taia, but she was reluctant to give me her name. She told me she loved her guests, and she didn't know why I was treating her badly. I didn't feel I was treating her badly, but I really couldn't understand why she just couldn't confirm with the kitchen to make me comfortable. I started to get upset. She wouldn't look at me or address me with respect. She kept looking at one of the members of my party, who was also black, as if asking him to reason with me. I suddenly felt like I was being treated differently because of my Indian descent. When Danny returned to the table, he found me tearful. 

I didn't eat my meal. The manager later came over to give us the check and aggressively showed the members of the party the note about not having oysters in the dish. She did take that off of the bill, along with an order of oysters that had not arrived before our entrees. There was no other apology, because she felt she was fully correct in not double checking that my meal was safe for me to eat. 

At the end of the meal, she came back to our table, and asked if there was anything else she could do. I told her I would have been fine had she just checked with the kitchen, and tried to explain how serious my vegetarianism was. At this point she interrupted me and again told me I had been treating her very badly on Mother's Day. She actually suddenly decided to tell me she had checked with the kitchen, and told me she had checked with the kitchen four times. I had misunderstood her. This is another moment where I felt I was being treated differently by Taia due to my race. Perhaps she assumed English wasn't my first language. I had been stubborn about needing this confirmation earlier to feel safe, and she had explicitly told me that she would not do it. I know I did not misunderstand her. She then accused me of not saying thank you like other members in our party. I certainly had nothing I felt thankful about when it came to her service. Our waiter Danny had received plenty of thanks. I was extremely upset about the way I was treated here. The food was fine, but this sort of disrespect was unacceptable.",2018-05-14 12:21:58

We ordered a dozen charbroiled oysters and also jambalaya. We also checked in to get crab claws.

First thing's first, the crab claws were delicious but if you're hoping to redeem your Yelp check in make sure you realize it only covers up to $10. We were not made aware of the fact until later, though our waiter was more than aware that we had to order two entrees. Feels a bit uneasy to be slighted as such.

For the entree, they were very mediocre. For the same price you can have the absolute most delicious charbroiled oysters at Acme(biggest fan). Here I'm not sure what I ate. Melted butter with garlic? Couldn't taste any of the grill. This is the way I would have prepared it at my house, but I'm also not spending $17 on a dozen.

For the jambalaya, I tasted a bit and realized that it was not what I hoped. To be honest the Jambalaya at Popeye's would have been better than what I ate here. Bland and mushy shrimp. Very off putting.

We drove over towards CBD to check in at our hotel, and by foot we made it to Royal House by 2300. Note: their hours state they close at midnight, what's amazing is their kitchen closes at midnight too so they're not rushing or keeping customers out. I will definitely give them a plus for that.

My general census of the food: salty!

Chargrilled oysters: whoever said they taste better than Acme believes anything caked in butter, garlic, and parmesan is culinary genius. If that's your bag, anything in butter, garlic, and cheese would be delicious.

Crab claws: would have been my favorite dish if they toned down the side of hypertension. So salty I downed two glasses of water.

Shrimp creole: underwhelming. Anyone can pick up a shrimp creole base at the nearby market and make it a hit at home.

Drink of choice - hurricane: I can't fathom why a mass majority of people who told me about New Orleans advised me to get this cocktail. I suppose when you're 19 here for mardi gras it would be the answer to what you're looking for, but for you mature, lover of spirits, this drink would be an offense taken seriously.

With those oysters you MUST get the crab claws. It's their sauce that makes this dish, I could eat that sauce the whole day, a decadent , rich and creamy sensation for the state buds. We had a group of twelve and we had to repeatedly order this dish throughout our time there. So oysters and crab claws are a must. The oysters beignet was also very interesting.

I was wandering through the French Quarter looking for some good eats, when I found myself sitting upstairs at the Royal House Oyster House.  I immediately noticed the authentic New Orleans vibe complete with slow spinning fans, southern accents, jazzy tunes and porch seating.  Upon sitting I was quickly served by a dynamite waitress named Allison.  

While Allison was extremely familiar with the menu, to be expected for a server, her most impressive trait was answering any and all questions in a clear, concise, and polite manner.  I don't like to be bothered often while dining, but Allison seemed to  exhibit a spider-sense the exact moment I required assistance.  I was blown away by her explanation of  cooking protocol in regards to beignets, since in the Empire state we don't eat such things.  I ordered an out-of-character trio of redfish beignets, crawfish raviolis, and a Hurricane drink, a first for having all three, all flawlessly recommended by Allison.

I had think to myself, what did I do to deserve such great day service this day?  I chalked it up to good luck, so I took my chances and asked Allison out on a date.  Even in this embarrassing, awkward situation Allison smiled politely as always and said she was already taken.  Rats!

Sincerely,
Reggie",2013-05-19 00:05:23

I had been wanting to try shrimp and grits in New Orleans.  We walked a few more steps, stopped, and pulled up Yelp to look at the reviews of Royal House.  They looked good so we turned around and went back.

We were immediately seated on the balcony.  It was nice, except the balcony does slope, which means your table and chair are sloped as well.  A little scary when you have plates and glasses on the table, but we didn't have any problems with anything sliding off.  

I did end up getting the shrimp and grits, and they were delicious.  The grits were creamy with a peppery, cheese, and herb flavor.  The creole sauce had a spicy yet slight vinegar flavor which perfectly balanced the creaminess of the grits.  The shrimp were plentiful and cooked well.  Hubby had the crawfish étouffée and he raved about it.  I don't really care for crawfish, but I had a bite of his dish and had to agree it was quite good.

I'm so glad we happened to find this place.  The service and food were both great.  The door greeter had an awesome personality and we wouldn't have tried this place if it weren't for him.  Prices were reasonable.  We will definitely be back when we visit New Orleans again.",2015-10-22 18:08:30

It was around 8pm on a Friday night and it seemed that every other place we wanted to try had an enormous line out front. We stumbled onto the RHOB as we were heading to our hotel down the street (The Monteleone) and I guess our timing was good. They seated us right away!

The atmosphere was very ""old school"" N'awlins, and packed full of happy people. That means that it's kind of loud, but we scored a corner table downstairs so it wasn't as bad as it could have been.

We started off with cocktails from their promotional menu (a Citrus Vodka Something-or-Other) and they were potent and delicious. We ordered Oysters Rockefeller as an appetizer, I had the Seafood Pescatore for my entrée, and my husband had the blackened Redfish with veggies and potatoes.

Neither of us had ever had Oysters Rockefeller before and we'll probably never get them again. They were fine, I guess, but next time I'll stick to getting them raw, or fried and put into a po'boy. My husband really enjoyed his Redfish with veggies and potatoes. He cleaned his plate! I was a bit less than thrilled with my Seafood Pescatore. The shrimp, mussels, clams, and scallops were fine but I didn't care for the marinara sauce. It was too sweet. I wasn't happy that I got just two medium sized scallops, and one of the clams and one of the mussels didn't open during cooking.

Holy crap, seriously Royal House? The sauteed crab claws came with about 10 crab claws in a rich, creamy broth with four pieces of French bread to dip into the sauce. Delicious, delicious. My husband and I split this app yesterday but he is crazy if he thinks he is going to share it when we go back. And we WILL go back for that app today. I also had a cup of gumbo that was very good and a little spicy. In addition, to satisfy my crawfish fix, I ordered the crawfish cakes. Wow. I was a little worried since I am not generally into crabcakes, but these were so good. The crawfish cakes were also topped with chunks of crawfish and a creamy crawfish sauce over a bed of spinach. All that crawfish fit the bill perfectly for me. 

The table behind us ordered poboys and they looked huge! It seemed like you got your money's worth with those. Given we only have another day left in Nawlins, I won't waste my time with the poboys although they looked very good. My heart belongs with those sauteed crab claws.",2010-12-20 16:09:53

We search the menu and decided to try the Oyster Tacos and the Shrimp and Chicken Jambalaya. We were originally seated on the second floor but we were able to eat on the balcony! This was definitely on my New Orleans bucket list and the weather was beautiful. 

So for the food...
1. The oyster tacos were very yummy! The fried oyster and slaw was on a tortilla chip and the flavor was good. Only downside was that it was expensive for so little. The tacos was small and came with only 4 tacos. So 2 for me and 2 for mother. I wish there were more tacos for $14.

2. The Jambalaya was great as well! The seasoning was good and there were little chicken or beef (I don't know what it was) pieces in the rice that was so good! Highly recommended and I would eat there again!",2017-06-11 22:59:23

On a Saturday night, we came here a bit early to miss the dinner rush. Royal House is right smack in the middle of the French Quarter, if you are exploring, you will run into it at some point. 

Our waiter was great. He made recommendations, chatted with us and was just so friendly! However, everyone in NOLA made us feel like we were at home. Southern Hospitality is real life here. We decided to start with the crab claw appetizer. It was out of this world! the sauce on the claws was stupid good. When we had finished the crab, our waiter brought us french bread so that we could eat all of the sauce! YUM YUM! For my entree, I choose the taste of New Orleans, which came with gumbo, jambalaya and crawfish etouffee.  Even though they all sound pretty similar, it was great to see and taste the differences in each dish. My favorite was the jambalaya. I would order this as my main on my next visit!

We had the oysters for an appetizer twice, the one where you get to sample two types, then we had the mahi mahi and the ""Taste of New Orleans"" platter. The best seafoods I've had in a while. The mahi had the perfect spiciness and after taste kick... I can't explain it. As i juggled that with my wife's sampler platter, my mouth grew confused with the onslaught of flavors. Each meal was drastically different yet both prenominal. 

We had the bread pudding the day before fit desert. The waiter recommended it to us... He said something to us in confidentially about that particular desert, but what i will share is that that particular desert is made by only one person, no other person can make it. It's an old family recipe. He also went on to say that they only allow a few people to cook a few things in the kitchen. That must be true, because the appetizers and dessert was consistently good both times.

The hostess for this place is outside and seated us inside as soon as we walked up-- we came on a week day before 4pm (not so crowded). After we were seated the hostess did not come to our table for 10 minutes. When she finally came to our table she quickly came by and rushed our drink order. It was another 5 minutes before she came by for our food order, and it seemed as if she didn't want to be there and just wanted to rush us. I tried the house gumbo that came out fast, and it was pretty good-it was sausage  and meat based, with no seafood--but not my favorite gumbo in New Orleans. Our problems came when waiting for the food. It was over 20 minutes and our waitress kept saying it was coming but it never came and we saw other tables receive their food that came after us. We finally stopped a manager and asked her to check on our food. She did and told us only five more minutes (on top of the 20 minutes). Five more minutes and no food. I was really hungry and it was not that busy, so I did not want to stay any longer. I asked a second manager for the check because the food never came and I just wanted to pay for the gumbo and go. He asked us what the issue was and I told him our food had not come after waiting so long and our waitress has not come back by, noticing our food had taken a long time. After the second manager, the waitress finally stopped by and still pretended like everything was normal. We told her we were ready to go. The manager finally came, back to our table after the food arrived--which I no longer wanted--to let us know he took care of the gumbo. I'm not sure why he had to make use wait any longer and could not tell us when he first stopped by. The food did look delicious but the service here dropped their ratings all the way down to a one.

I will definitely order it again. The wife had a blackened chicken sandwich $12 but subbed it on French bread since they don't have a Blackened Chicken Po Boy (a little weird they don't).

They have a very extensive wine list and the prices are what is to be expected. Our waitress was very nice and attentive. She had no problem taking my yelp coupon for a free appetizer. We got the seafood stuffed mushrooms with it and they were an incredible start. We also got the raw oysters which were very large and well worth the price. Very fresh!  We were seated upstairs and could see out the big open double doors to the patio which overlooked the strip. If you have a party of 2 you can sit out there and enjoy overlooking the street while eating. We would definitely recommend this place. The food was good for the price.

I would definitely recommend ordering the Crab Claws.  The claws are already pre-cracked so it is not messy to eat at all.  The flavor was amazing and it reminded me of the sauce used on the chargrilled oysters at Cochon.  Definitely recommend ordering the chargrilled oysters here as well and putting the crab claw sauce on them.

The Red fish beignet was also unique.  It had a sweet taste almost like a funnel cake but with a piece of fish inside.  It sounds like an odd combination but surprisingly it worked.

Cleanliness: we sat at the bar and I immediately noticed it was a little messy. My original thought was that a few people had cleared out and they would get to it. NOPE. The bar looked like it needed a good wipe down.  Menus were just lying around (and they were not laid out in preparation for incoming patrons). I eventually put the cap on an open bottle of hot sauce that was next to me. My gut said leave, and unfortunately I didn't listen.

Service: our bartender looked like he was cleaning out some sort of oyster bin. Is that really necessary in the middle of dinner hour? That would explain why the bar was a mess and there was a lack of attentiveness. He seemed to find plenty of time to chat when a friend came in though. 

Food: I have had chargrilled oysters before. These were unlike any I have had, and not in a good way. The ""topping"" was much more like a broken down sauce and running all over the place. Gumbo lacked flavor and had way too much rice.

We also noticed that people had the Blackened Redfish, we think it's just okay, kinda dried.  The waiter had recommended the seafood pescatore, which is a seafood pasta.  It has a nice tomato marinara sauce that is very appetizing.

By the time we finished our snack, my happiness returned and Hubbs changed his mind about ACME. So we decided to go somewhere around the area, and Royal House was our lucky location (short line + 4 stars = winner).

When I checked in, I saw that we got a free appetizer, so we ordered the Redfish Beignets (my hope was a perfect mix of sweet and savory). And since I wasn't that hungry, I got a bowl of French Onion soup. Hubbs ordered two orders of the Chargrilled Oysters (12 total) and the gumbo.

Redifsh Beignets were... kind of weird. I guess I was thinking that the batter was going to be more fluffy than crunchy. To me, it was just deep fried fish with syrup on it. The french onion soup was perfect... great onion flavor, good layer of melty, gooey cheese with a crustini on top. I'm not a fan of gumbo, so I thought Hubbs' gumbo was okay but he liked it. And he really liked the oysters and gobbled them up in a hot second.

Later we found out that the appetizer wasn't complimentary. Mainly because we were supposed to order two entrees in order to get that deal. Our waiter could've told us, but just gave us a full-priced bill instead. Whomp whomp.

I guess being a not-fan of seafood makes me feel ""meh"" about this place. I wouldn't come back.",2014-06-05 19:35:15

Went out for a late meal on Saturday night with no reservation. We were seated right away at a cozy table, and waiter took our drink order immediately. So tired of beer and bourbon from a full week in the Big Easy, I opted for something a little more girly - a sour apple martini. Hubby had a bloody mary. Both werre declicious, and under $10.
For dinner I ordered the shrimp and grits. OH. MY. GAWD. these were delicious. At least 10 juicy shrimp on a bed of the most delicious grits I had over the whole trip. The chopped veggies and gouda really  give them a great flavour and creaminess. WISH I had found grits like these earlier in the week.
Hubby had the blackened shrimp and jambalaya. He raved about his meal too. Jambalaya was full of flavour, and his shrimp were really good (I may have tried one when he wasn't looking...). Both meals were served piping hot and portion sizes were generous. With an appetizer, we probably could have split a meal.

Entrees were lackluster. Sautéed crab claws were nothing like we've had in the past here. They were small and about half the amount that used to go out of that kitchen. And the ribeye was an overly salted and overcooked thin piece of fat. Only good thing we had were the raw oysters.

The strengths of this place are the oysters. Get the chargrilled. Oysters in butter with parmesan cheese?! Can't go wrong.

We also ordered the Taste of New Oreans- my favorite was the Etouffe! I had never had it before, but it's like a creamy seafood soup. I would get that again as an individual item.

After between 5-10 minutes, we still hadnt been greeted by a server. Then another couple was seated next to us and it was very quick after that the server showed up and spoke to them first, took their drink orders and food orders and told us she would be with us shortly. She finally came to us and took our drink order then asked what we wanted to eat. We ordered drinks then my husband stated we were still  looking at the menu to which she responded ""well I saw y'all sitting there so I figured you were ready."" Yes, we were ready to order our drinks you never took. I got my drink not long after but it took at least 10 minutes to get my husband's beer. Our food came within a reasonable time frame. It was delicious, even though I'm not sure how they run out of shrimp and grits? I really had my sights on that but ended up having to order a sandwich which again was tasty.

Would've given more stars, but the food we ate, wasn't too sure if it was the oysters, gave us bad stomachaches. Not a pleasant feeling when we were looking forward to enjoying our last night in Louisiana. :/

I'm not usually one to complain about high prices, but don't go here for a Po' Boy if you're actually a po' boy and can't hang with the $13 sandwich. Go down the street to Johnny Po Boys and get yourself a nice 8 dollar sandwich and spend the rest on a drink somewhere.
I had the oysters (they were good, though I preferred Acme by a long shot) and the boyfriend had the BLT-O, which I think was seriously a $17 sandwich. It wasn't very impressive by any means.
The service was awesome, very old-school and totally delightful. Overall, I wouldn't come back here when there are so many other great options within walking distance.

Small Kine... Axe To Grind!

We asked if we could use two yelp coupons for two appetizers for our party of 4 and were told that we could by our otherwise wonderful server. So with this information, we ordered two appetizers with our 4 entrees and 6 drinks. At the end of our meal, we were told that a mistake had been made and that we would have to pay for one appetizer. We said this was bait and switch and was not acceptable. 

After making us wait a long time, and being treated politely by us...the manager (Stephanie) lied to us about how it was impossible for her to discount the appetizers and rudely said there was nothing she could do other than make the server pay for the other appetizer. Really? How about this...don't put the appetizer on the bill! Or just treat us as if we were at two separate tables! Don't make up excuses about your food billing system. AND DON'T LIE TO US! 

Stephanie, you ruined what was otherwise a very nice dinner for us with your obstinacy and small mindedness over 10 frickin dollars. I hope that perhaps an owner or manager will read this and have a talk with you about your poor attitude. If so, perhaps you could request additional customer service training and learn to treat people better? I gave you every chance to do the right thing and your choice was to lie to me and blame and threaten your server.  That's weak sauce.

Otherwise...the food was pretty good. Our server gave us the wrong info on the appetizers and kind of screwed up our order but he was polite and helpful so he gets a pass on that. The atmosphere was ok. If it weren't for the customer service fail...I would say 3.5 stars.",2012-07-10 06:08:59

v_6cojcit3nTTjmDoBMUPw,N61NZ9hdhezJ5LxDdiHmBQ,VQcCL9PiNL_wkGf-uF3fjg,2,1,0,0,"The ""taste of New Orleans"" which was supposed to be a jambalaya,  Étouffée and gumbo was total rip off. The trifecta came in dinky little cups and each one was so full of rice there was little to taste, the jambalaya although primarily a rice dish was all rice with one little barely bite sized piece of sausage and and a few little crumbs of other stuff, rice was dry and under cooked, unbelievably boring for New Orleans restaurant providing signature dishes. All that for a way over priced amount of $17. I wanted to throw the the while damn plate into the street. I was so pissed at the bs. I even asked the waiter to confirm if he thought it was something he would recommend.

 I also tried a half doz oysters which tasted good and fresh but were poorly shucked and had more broken shell and debris than normal. The place was really slow too so it wasnt like their shuckker was backed up. The shrimp creole was pretty good nicely flavored. I also took the waiter up on his beer recomendation which turned out to be in a can which I would not have ordered if I knew that.  We sat on the balcony over looking Royal St which with the creole was the only real redeaming factors of the experience.  The reviews on this place are somewhat mixed and I was told to ignore them but based on my experience I couldn't  recommend it. It might be one of those places you have to know what to order, but that won't be me finding that out.",2014-02-18 23:57:18

Hjzm3cpkt4kxd7d2AxXP4g,Tu33FYUqEd9008t8_xgogg,VQcCL9PiNL_wkGf-uF3fjg,1,1,0,0,"First I have to begin by stating that I have never written a review for a restaurant before; however, the service that me and my family received today was so terrible that I felt the need to warn others regarding this horrid restaurant.

Here is what went wrong:

We ordered our food and drinks and received two of the four entrees along with our sides within fifteen minutes. The two that had yet to arrive were the Taste of New Orleans and the Seafood Pot. Ten minutes later we were informed by a different waiter that they did not have lobster so they were not able to make the Seafood Pot and later brought us the Alaskan Crab Pot, of which we did not ask for and thus had to return. At this time, we also inquired about the Taste of New Orleans since it had been nearly thirty minutes since ordering and the waiter stated that it was hectic in the kitchen and would now put in the order. Nearly fifteen minutes goes by before the waiter comes back and tells us that our food is on it's way. Twenty minutes and two inquiries later, our food comes and is lukewarm. At this point we just wanted to get our food, eat, and leave as soon as possible. When we got the bill it was a complete disaster. We were charged for three things that we didn't get and both the waiter and management unsuccessfully tried to argue their case as to why we needed to pay the full amount. Once paying the correct bill, we gladly left the restaurant as fast as we could. It is important to mention that our waiter, Billy, did the best that he could, but it just didn't pay off due to a plethora of factors. 

My take away:

A majority of tourists in New Orleans are seeking to have a good time and try some delicious Cajun food. Here, some of the dishes are good while others are mediocre at best. However, no matter the quality of the food, I feel that the environment and management of this establishment truly dampened a possibly wonderful experience. I will never come here again nor recommend it to anyone.",2017-12-25 23:45:31

I mean NOLA certainly has its fair share of places with fresh oysters, but these were the size of my fist with so much flavor. They shucked them right in front of you if you're sitting at the bar enjoying an amazing bloody mary. Which is exactly what we did. We got the creole shrimp and the taste of louisiana? but both were filled with so much flavor. The shrimp was in a flavorful red sauce and we didn't even use the rice it came with because we loved the flavor by it self. The taste of louisana had three bowls of three different things, and my favorite was by far the jambalaya. 
Our bar tender was so nice and really told us about the menu based on expectations of flavor and his personal favorites. I loved this place.

Just walk halfway down the street and grab a drink from the lil beer and frozen drink stand and time will go a little faster while standing in line.

They sent us to be seated upstairs on the balcony. After reading y'all's reviews I was hoping for just that. The seating process seemed a bit disorganized but the upstairs hostess was nice. Place was packed. Our server (Diego maybe?) was great. Friendly and knew his menu. The bf had one of the best bloodies I have ever tried. I almost got my own but just couldn't do it after the whirlwind of travel - I was already delirious and also dehydrated - but I regret not ordering one myself. Wish I had one now. It came garnished with a pickled green bean, celery, olive and onion. So good.

Everything is a little slow going.
Drinks came slow, apps came really slow - like maybe 40 minutes, but Diego came to keep us updated. I get it - in a place like that the kitchen gets backed up sometimes. Despite our hunger we were really enjoying the night air and some good music as there were two ladies playing on the corner below - A violinist and guitar player. It was like having a free show. 

For apps we had the spinach dip and the Crab Louis Salad. Dip was ok. Came with what seemed to be house made tortilla chips. The portion was a bit small. The salad was good. It sounds a little strange, kind of a weird combination of things but it works. The dressing was really good too and they gave just the perfect amount. 

For our mains my boyfriend had the taste of New Orleans which consists of Gumbo, jumbalaya, & étouffée. Neither one of us are big seafood eaters so he was taking a chance here. He liked the jumbalaya and loved the étouffée, but thought the gumbo had a strange flavor. He described it as tasting of vodka. Who knows? It's New Orleans, maybe it is made with vodka and maybe it's supposed to be. I tried it and tasted vodka as well but it was also reminiscent of something else and had a smokiness to it.

I decided to be a weirdo and order a shit ton of sides as my main course. When I was looking at the menu on yelp it had all of these things listed under Lagniappe...stupid me I thought it was like a combination plate which I felt was perfect because I'm a glutton and usually want one of everything. So I had my heart set on that only to get there and realize that this was a list of the available side dishes. Since I had my heart set on it already I ordered the red potatoes; the slaw; the corn maque choux; the jumbalaya; and hush puppies.

Everything was really good. The hush puppies were the best I've ever had. Slaw was good but different from any I've ever had. It is made with apples and I also tasted some cinnamon in there. It was good but a little sweet for my taste. This was my first time ever trying jumbalaya. It was delicious. Also my first time having maque choux. The corn was a little over cooked but I liked this dish as well. Kind of like a combination of corn and New England clam chowder cuz it definitely had a seafood flavor in there. My favorite thing was the red potatoes. Swimming in butter, garlic and Parmesan cheese. Flavor got a bit intense as I got to the bottom where all the sauce collected. Not healthy in the slightest but oh very delish.

I heard a server tell the table next to us that they sold out of the banana foster cheesecake. I was pretty bummed because I had my heart set on that. Oh well I'm developing a tire around my waist on this trip anyway. 

All in all it was a great nite but I've deducted stars for the cleanliness factor, or lack thereof...

The oysters were tiny and fairly tasteless, and there wasn't anything on the rest of the plate that could be described as tasty or interesting.

Struggling to understand why people rate this place. The food was totally underwhelming and definitely doesn't live up yo it's reputation. Won't be coming back",2014-10-07 16:04:09

So we came back the next night. We were seated in the upstairs dining room promptly but it took over 7 minutes for our waitress, Cindy, to acknowledge us.  She was very busy toting plates of oysters up the stairs to diners in her section.  She was very animated and funny, but was sort of frustrated with her coworkers earlier in the day, with her neighbor, and with the very melancholy singer outside the window across the street.  Not sure why she shared this information with us... maybe because it was late, or because we seemed friendly and receptive... Its fine, just not what we expected in a restaurant that seemed to be a pretty old-school, formal place. (At least they were not so fancy so as to be bothered with us showing up in very casual day clothes!) She was very helpful with menu suggestions, however, and we placed our order, taking advantage of the yelp complimentary appetizer.) It took a long time to get our beverages, a coke and a bottled beer. Our appetizer came out next. We got fried gator bites, which were great.  For the main course, my BF got a fried seafood sampler. I got linguine with fried oysters mushrooms, and spinach. My BF's platter looked like it was from a county fair or something. Mainly fries and hush puppies, a little catfish and shrimp. Basically a huge ""kiddie plate,"" but he said it was good. My food was tasty but very light on oysters, spinach, and mushrooms. I got lemon and red pepper to enhance the cream sauce, which was heavier than I expected.   We got the deconstructed bananas foster cheesecake for dessert. It was heavy but tasted fine.  The graham cracker ""cookie"" in the middle was a brick and nearly impossible to break with forks.  So as the girl outside bleated on with her torchy renditions of Sarah McLaughlin, Joni Mitchell, etc., and our waitress griped jovially about all kinds of stuff, we rolled back out into the quarter with our bellies full, wondering how we could have made a better dining decision on our last night in NOLA.",2014-06-04 23:04:50

Checking in on yelp scores you a free app and we got the crab claws. Let me tell you about them crab claws. Abso-effing-loutly the best thing I have ever tried. It was mostly the sauce that had me wanting to lick the bowl, but the crab meat itself was super soft and tender. Plenty for two to share.

I also tried the gumbo, which was the main reason why I picked this place, however, it didn't compare to the crawfish etouffee. I've never had crawfish before and I'm glad I had it here for my first time. The crawfish come in two ways, fried and then in the sauté. Don't mix the fried ones in, (as the waitress advised!) because you're supposed to have a little crunch with this meal.

Our server was the festively plump Latino server who reminded my wife and I of Katsuji from Top Chef season 12. You're better off if you have someone else as your server as he wasn't really around when we needed him, and when we flagged him down, he'd tell us he'd be right there, and continue in his conversation with another server.

The place is pretty crowded in that there isn't much space between your table and the next in their more general seating area. 

We ordered the Peel-n-Eat Shrimp, the Taste of New Orleans, and the Fried Alligator. The Peel-n-Eat Shrimp were okay with a little spice, but the shells seemed to stick firmly onto the shrimp so that by the time you got it all off, your piece of shrimp looked like it had been run over by an 18-wheeler. Poor skills on our part I guess. They were cooked well, but could have used more flavor. Something like $16 for a pound.

Fried Alligator tasted like overdone frog legs. Nothing special. Too much fried batter. Wish I didn't order it.

The Taste of New Orleans was pretty disappointing. They had a small cup of the etouffee, and a small cup of the gumbo accompanied with a small up of their jambalaya. The jambalaya was chalky dry and all the items in it were severely overcooked. The two soups came out lukewarm and were all in all disappointing. I like my soups hot. I think the temperature helps make or break a soup. So these soups were pretty saddening.

The ravioli was amazing. It was so tasty I couldn't get enough - it was cheesy and had great Cajun flavor with just a hint of spice. The crawfish was the perfect compliment to the ricotta. The shrimp was really fresh and delicious a little bit spicier but just a little kick not too hot.

There was a small amount of each of jambalaya, gumbo, and etouffee at the bottom of some small soup cups, which were then covered in rice.  Each was about 70% rice, which gave me only a few bites of the actual entrees I ordered.  This was truly absurd at $18.  It also took about an hour to come out of the kitchen.  My wife ordered a salad, which was decent if overpriced.  But my daughter is the one who really made out well; she ordered a $5 kid's fried shrimp platter, and got an enormous amount of tasty fried shrimp and fries.  She got probably twice the amount of food for $5 that I received for $18, and though it was unhealthy and lacked diversity, it was fresh and tasty.

Was in town for Mardi Gras.  It was a buddy's bday weekend so an overall contingent of around 20 decided to meet in Nola for Mardi Gras, bday celebrations, general debauchery and well...  Reverting back to 18 and acting like idiots.  Maybe that was all redundant.  I don't care.  

So it was Saturday morning.  Mind you, I was in pain after Thurs night and all day drinkathon Friday.  Not the arthritis in my right ankle from years of soccer pain.  Nope, not that kind of pain.  The ice pick in the temple, dehydration where you don't pee until 4pm kind of pain.  Solution?  Bloody Marys.

So what do I do?  I refuse to hit up Bourbon Street or Harrah's (eventhough I pummeled the Black Jack table into a bloody mess on Friday night).  So I start walking from the Marriott.  Aimlessly at first, but then down Royal.  I have no idea where I'm going.  John H don't care.  John H just wants to eat shit and drink shit.  John H is hurting and wants to curl up like the Honey Badger, but he still don't care.

So I'm walking by this massive police station and reminded of times past in Nola and why I don't goto Bourbon Street even on Mardi Gras anymore.  I keep walking.  In the distance, I see the sign.  It seems like the clouds parted and a ray of sunlight was shining on it.  I figure either the Mardi Gras god's or the devil himself is pushing me towards this place.  Maybe the Mardi Gras god's and Beezlebub are the same entity.  Who cares.

I walk in and I'm literally the only person in there.  It is, afterall, like 10am Nola time.  Shennanigans.  I sit down and ask for my typical Ketel One and Bloody.  They guy behind the bar quickly says, ""sure you don't want to try it with the infused vodka""?  He points towards the large jar full of all things peppery, garlic like, etc.  I swear the damn thing had a light under it or maybe my vision was blurry due to lack of hydration.  

I say yes to this.  Not knowing where this beginning of the day would take me.  You see, I'm a gluton for punishment.  I think my liver is just this awesome toy that kind of has a bypass around it.  Put up yellow caution signs ""road closed"", alcohol please take the detour.  NOPE.  Just punish that sucker even more.  Bloody Mary was the best one I've had in a while.  So good I had two and one is usually all I need before moving on to different alcohol.

Food was next on the list.  Another bartender recommended their Chargrilled Oysters and Crab and Corn Bisque.  ""Ok, lady, don't give me any crap.  Is it as good as Drago's or not"".  I didn't really say it like that because I think she would've three-finger pimped slapped me, but it was what I was thinking.  She was awesome in her recommendations though.  Ordered that very shit she recommended.  

First, the Crab and Corn Bisque.  I want to free-base this stuff.  Should've gotten the bowl.  Just awesome.  Then I moved onto Chargrilled Oysters.  What happens when you combine large oysters, butter, spices, parmesan cheese and a grille?  You come up with slap your mama good stuff.  Not kidding, I would've slapped my mama if she tried to grab one off my plate.  And yes, they were better than Drago's.

As usual stupidity would allow, I decided to stay there another 3 hours while my friends trickled in.  It was during this time that Mardi Gras monsoon 2012 decided to start.  Have white shirt, will rain.  Thank you to the group of 4 women who came in for lunch wearing white shirts after the deluge started.  Your presence was noted and appreciated by all.

Big eff you to the weather though.  You rained out the Krewe of Tucks parade that we were all riding in.

Went on a busy Friday night. Ordered crab claws app, though the Yelp coupon gives you a free appetizer without a price stipulation (to my knowledge), they only discounted it $10. The app was tasty, though only about 8 tiny claws, no seafood fork to remove the meat was given, and it was barely warm

My date ordered the oyster duo, the oysters were dirty. 

I had the shrimp creole, only some shrimp were properly deveined. This dish was barely warm as well. It was nothing special.

Great location.  Spacious.  Second story balcony to occasionally pop out and see a Second Line coming down the street.  Wide windows open to let a nice breeze through while dining.

Unfortunately, there is a staff.  

While, most of the time the staff was friendly and accommodating they were not knowledgeable nor had any sense of urgency.  Getting a server was pretty damn difficult for our 10 top.  Getting a busser was pretty damn difficult.  getting more rounds of drinks ... was the hardest.  This should be actually the easiest.  

ANY server who knows anything wants to up-sale their table with booze as much as possible.  The tip increases as the bill increases.  The bill increases due to more drinks ordered.  More drinks ordered when you're around to ask or even check on the table.  Pretty easy...usually.

Then..the grub was really hit or miss.  The Po-Boys need a lot less bread.  The gumbos and other soups were amazing.  ... tough to really gauge what is going on when ten different orders all had a varying amount of satisfaction.

Within 5 minutes we were being rushed to finish our appetizers as a tray of our entrees were sitting there, waiting.  Which, at the time, I thought that was weird, but whatever, we were hungry.  Once I got my dish, the shrimp creole, it wasn't even warm.  I asked my family around me and found out that the Taste of New Orleans, the Shrimp and Grits and another rice plate were ALL cold.  All of the fries were cold as well.  I asked the server to reheat our plates, when they brought it back, it still wasn't hot.

Not once did we get an apology or a recognition of the bad service and cold food, we asked the server to bring the manager over to see if there was anything they can do.  The server says, ""Well, since you did eat all of the food, I don't know what it is that he can do"".  First of all, we did NOT eat all off the food.  Everything was cold and quite frankly, besides the oysters, the rest of the food wasn't even good.  My shrimp creole dish looked like half of it came out of a tomato paste can.  Gross.

As if the comment from the server wasn't already the worst customer service (remember you rushed me appetizers to give all cold food), the manager comes over and yells ""Who's the one who had the issues?""  The four of us at the end of the table with the cold food.  ME!  He comes over, not once apologized for anything or even asked me what the issues were.  Just showed me the bill and that they took of 15%.  SMH.  You couldn't even ask me what happened?  Never once acknowledge the fact that our service was below average.  Then come at us with ""Who is the one who had a problem?""  I SURE DID.

Unreal.  You're a restaurant.  Customer service should be your priority.  We are a nice family, looking to have a good time to be utterly dissapointed by the lack of service and rudeness from your establishment.",2013-11-06 20:53:13

Entree: The Crawfish Étouffée. I got it each time I was there because I didn't know how to not order it, when I came in. The restaurant was very generous with the crawfish. The fact that they added fried crawfish on top of the dish, it made it even more flavorful. Don't stir it around.

The oysters across several methods of preparation were just passable.

I was in New Orleans for a week & ate out 2-3x/day & this is hands down the worst place I ate at during my entire vacation. 
Started out with chargrilled oysters & oysters royal. The oysters came out lukewarm, cheese on the oysters royal had already coagulated, not ""bubbly"" per the menu. The chargrilled oysters did not have any chargrill flavor at all, it tasted as if they were just baked in the oven. We had chargrilled oysters just the day before & what we had was way better than what we got at Royal House. 
Our entrees included the shrimp jambalaya & the pecan-crusted mahi mahi. I'm sorry but what I got was not mahi mahi nor was it pecan crusted. I don't normally eat fish but when I do I tend to order the mahi mahi because of the mild taste & flaky texture, so I know what mahi mahi tastes like. I was expecting a 2 inch thick filet crusted with noticeable pecan pieces. No, I got a 1/4 inch thin filet that was just battered. I thought I was given the wrong dish that I asked 2 staffers if I got the right dish, of which they said I did. The mahi mahi was the fishiest tasting mahi mahi I had ever had in my life. The batter did not have any pecan taste to it. The ""chef's vegetable"" that came with the dish turned out to be soggy, overly salty green beans that have probably been sitting in a warm brine bath all day. I think the reason why they top the fish with the creamy shrimp sauce is to help hide the fishy taste of the mahi mahi; well it didn't work for me. 

Their bloody mary was also the worst we had in the city - basically tasted like we were drinking Worcestershire sauce straight. 

Our waitress probably picked up on my dissatisfaction because she didn't even offer us the dessert menu. I ate as much as I could tolerate then got the heck out of there. I cannot believe the price I paid for that dinner, it was not worth it.

2 girls + 5 plates = can't breathe 
We came here hungry after a 4 hour bike ride in a storm. We needed food NOW. So, what did we order? If you check-in, you get a free appetizer as long as you purchase 2 entrees... so, OBVIOUSLY we needed to take advantage of this sweet deal. 

- Stuffed Mushrooms: I thought this tasted like any other stuffed mushrooms. It was stuffed with crab and shrimp doused with mayo. What's new, right? 

- 1/2 dozen raw oysters: I didn't really like these that much. They were too big, and it didn't really taste too fresh. 

- 1/2 dozen charbroiled oysters: I loved these. They were seasoned well and cooked perfectly. I'm pretty sure it's not the healthiest choice, but it's definitely something you need to order. 

- Shrimp & Grits: This was probably one of the highlights of our lunch. I've become obsessed with shrimp and grits ever since my last trip to Florida, so any chance I get ... we're ordering it. 

- Taste of New Orleans: I don't think I enjoyed this as much as I would've liked. It was nice to try the Chicken & Andouille Jambalaya, Crawfish Etouffée and Chicken and Andouille Gumbo. BUT I don't think I'd recommend getting this dish, since neither of us really ate much of it.",2017-08-14 17:54:59

 For starters, we had the crab claws appetizer. As mentioned in many reviews it's all about the sauce but unfortunately for us we didn't get much of it and we had to ask for more bread which took forever to come.  For my entree, I had the oyster and eggplant pasta which was just ok. My boo had Shrimp po boy which was dry and bread was stale. He initially ordered something else but they informed us that a key ingredient was missing 30 mins after our order was placed. Lastly for dessert we had the bananas Fosters cheesecake and that  was good but the presentation was off. Overall, the waitress was horrible and not apologetic at all for the long wait and missing ingredient. In fact she had an attitude.

The only saving grace was the manager who was sincerely sorry that my birthday dinner was ruined and did his best to make things right. If the food was good maybe I'd call it an off night but too many things were just wrong and I had way better New Orleans food elsewhere.  I won't be back!",2017-07-06 00:43:50

First we had their famous Taste of new orleans. You get to taste 3 authentic dishes of NOLA with it. Of them 3, our favorite turned out to be crawfish etouffe. The texture spices and everything turned out to be great. So that's what we got for entry. 

Though, the best and must dish to have here is Crab claws. Trust me, you have to try it. It was like heaven. Very unique and tasty gravy with soft Crab claws. Ohh my god. Actually the subsequent day, we went at this place again to just have Crab claws. I am glad we listened to our waiter.

It took a little more time that I thought to get our drink order on this busy Saturday night, but I mentioned I desperately needed my water backer for my hurricane.  Well, one in our party got their soda, but that was it.  Diego, our waiter has 2 hands, yes?

About 10 minutes later, the cocktails came out, still no water.  Well, I would be considered the ""heavy"" drinker of this group as one is an almost ""never"" and the other 2 are just north of teetotalers.  I've had NOLA hurricanes before, and liked the buzz and the traditional lamp style glass.  The one I was served, had neither.  But it gets worse...

The 2 mint juleps generated blasé responses.  Even one said ""it was like I remembered from Disneyland (non-alcohol).""  There were even dead brown/black mint leaves in one glass.  I've never had this drink, but according to the provided drink list, it should have had simple syrup, mint and booze.  The drink was reported as ""not sweet at all, and very little booze.""  I said they MUST HAVE put soda water in it, since I know ss is 50/50 sugar/water.  And to make matter even worse, my lightweight drink was $10 and I think the others were either $8 or $10 for single shots of liquor.  A quick google check on several recipes showed me how BAD their drinks are.

The food was much better fortunately, my ""Taste of NO"" was a solid 3-3.5 stars, but VERY light on the meat,  and my buddy's beef po boy and gumbo was at least that, although our server couldn't remember to bring a spoon for his soup.  The Mahi-mahi was ""excellent"" (and well portioned) but the fried catfish wasn't near as good as Oceana.  And all this time as the server cleared my cocktail glass, my empty water went unfilled until I asked.

Poor drinks and shoddy service, 1 star.  3.5 stars for the food. Overpriced for what the reputation is.  You can do better!",2015-01-11 04:34:41

- Oysters Duo: comes with 6 grilled oysters in 2 flavors, delicious!!, probably my favorite thing here and definitely comparable if not better than the grilled oysters at Acme

- Redfish Beignets: wanted to try this since it seemed different from the typical dish you'd find, basically was battered fish with sauces and powdered sugar, not bad but wasn't awesome like i expected

- Crawfish Etouffee: probably the best crawfish etouffee i've ever had, there was both fried and unfried crawfish which helped make the dish interesting to eat

Definitely a must! My boyfriend had the shrimp tortellini and it was pretty good. I wanted to get the shrimp and grits solely because the picture on their website looked good. I ordered it and it was nothing close at all. The shrimp sauce was horrible and the grits were inedible. I got to swap it out for the crawfish ravioli and it was so much better. They even took the shrimp and grits off the ticket. Pretty small portions for the price but it's all about location.,2017-10-01 01:46:39

Thanks to Gini R for Yelping this on her recent visit to NOLA. I bookmarked it right away and brought my partner here for lunch on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. We were ushered up to the balcony to experience the wonderful sights and sounds of NOLA. The dining room upstairs has a great atmosphere with white table clothes, hardwood floors and open doors, reminiscence of the colonial-style ""kopitiam"" around south-east asia!

Being in the south and famous for their sweet tea, i asked the waiter if they have something like ""Twisted Tea"", he came back with a cocktail called ""Firefly"" $6.50, I think its vodka with sweetened grapefruit tea, definitely refreshing even though i am not a big fan of spirit! We ordered the following:

Taste of New Orleans $15.95, I was suckered into ordering this as they described it as ""The Holy Trinity, a sampling of cities best dishes, chicken & sausage jambalaya, crawfish etouffe & chicken & sausage gumbo"", i sub the gumbo for seafood. Basically, each dishes in cup with 3 thin slices of baguette. The jambalaya was the best, both the etouffe & gumba were a bit runny, still tasty but not WOW!

Royal Spinach Salad $10.95 add $4.95 grilled shrimp + $4.95 blackened scallop ($20.85). Baby spinach, sliced red apples, blue cheese, craisins & candied pecans with balsamic vinaigrette, now this is WOW! A perfect lunch dish that is very refreshing especially in summer time temp. Of course you can skip the additional but we both love our seafood...

I know there's plenty of restaurants in this beautiful city that has similar ambiance and setting but Royal House started our day wonderfully before venturing further into the French Quarter.

My bach party had ballooned to 18 guys. We were at Pat O'Briens and it was about 6pm. We had 830 reservations. I was STARVING, and wanted some local fare. 

I whipped out the Yelp app and put in oysters, and Royal House was tenths of a mile away. I was so happy I may or may not have shed a drop. Me and 4 buddies dipped out for some oysters, promising to meet the rest of the fellas at our rezzy. 

Walked in and they had 5 spots at the bar. Destiny my friends. 

Two gents behind the bar were already shucking oysters. Didn't even need to see a menu. A dozen for me. 

Growing up in Boston, you learn to appreciate fresh seafood. Living in Nashville now, you can get good seafood, but you have to pay a premium for it. And, it's missing that extra element of fresh that you just can't get in a non-port town. That being said, these oysters were so fresh, I was amazed.

After 2-3 minutes wait, my party of 9 was seated in the upstairs dining room.  I'll cut to the chase: I absolutely loved Royal House!  In fact, we all did. The food was delicious. 

We had gumbo, raw bar, chargrilled oysters (drool), caprese salad, French onion soup (the BEST any of us had ever had), stuffed mushrooms and drinks. I really don't have the words to express how fresh and delicious the food was.  Everything was perfectly seasoned. The F.O. soup had a very light, yet extremely yummy creaminess to it. Not really noticeable to the eye, but you could see it's richness on the spoon and feel it on your tongue.

But wait...there's more! Not only did the food have our taste buds doing the happy dance, the service we received was top notch! Our server-Ty, a Nola native- was extremely pleasant and well informed about the menu, ingredients and preparations. He asked about our taste preferences and offered recommendations on food and drink. And his suggestions were spot-on.  With such a large party, i was overwhelmingly pleased at how quickly our various courses and orders arrived to the table. 

In my opinion, Royal House is the kind of place that makes you want to return to a city just to further experience the menu.  In a city rich with excellent restaurants and even more menu options, i would (and will) recommend Royal House to anyone and everyone who asks!

We chose this place with the thousands of reviews and an average of 4 stars plus the free appetizer and we were starving! We came here around 2:45 pm on a Thursday.  We were seated immediately on the balcony. It was not very crowded. It took about 10 minutes to get a menu and the waitress asked us if we wanted a menu...uh yeah? On top of that, it took another 20 minutes for her to take our food orders and drink orders at the same time. We ordered two diet cokes, oyster tacos (free app), alligator po boy, and blt oyster po boy. Still no diet cokes.

I had finally just gone up to the bar to get the two diet cokes after not being given a beverage in 45 minutes of being there. The bartender apologized yet our waitress seemed unphased. 

We had contemplated leaving, but decided to wait it out. It was cold outside so we decided to grab an inside table, not that our waitress seemed to care. About 55 minute of being there we got our free oyster tacos. Definitely NOT tacos but 4 fried oysters on top of 4 small chips.  It was good, but hardly an appetizer.

Over an hour being there we finally got our food. It was hard to enjoy after such an annoying experience. I would have more sympathy if the people who worked there seemed to care but they really didnt. After tax it was about 43 for drinks and food...felt like we shouldn't have gotten charged for barely getting a soft drink.

How do they keep their line moving? Well that's cause this place is PACKED. Seats are back to back, not the most spacious setting. Also since the restaurant has multiple windows that stay open to the outdoors, you get that humidity from outside. Lastly it wasn't the cleaniest or freshest smelling restaurant. So overall with the crowdedness, humidity, and dirty smell...ehhh not my favorite environment.

- - f o o d - - 
Overall, the food was mediocore and prices were ehh a bit on the steep side for what I got...

[ [ fried alligator ] 
FREE WITH CHECK-IN! Well you can get any appetizer, but I mean when else would I be able to try alligator (you usually don't see this in California). This was good! I didn't know what to expect...so they tasted like popcorn chicken bits...not bad!

[ [ raw oysters ] ]
Good! These weren't the best oysters I've had but they weren't bad! Size wise, they were pretty small. But they fresh so you didn't get too much of that raw fishy taste. 

[ [ blackened shrimp & jambalaya ] ]
This was sooooooo good!! They are generous with the shrimp....packed with flavor (for both the shrimp and jambalaya). I really wanted to get some authentic NOLA food and yumm this was it! The jambalya was absolutely delicious! The shrimp and jambalya complemented each other great and I really liked it! I would've loved it but ughh my food came out on the cool-warm side! Why?!

[[ crawfish etouffee ] ]
Again, I loved the flavor and everything but it was cold! The gravy was great and again it came with lots of fried crawfish tails. You definitely want to eat this fast before it gets all soggy! 

Overall...I'm just torn. I loved the food, but it was cold which is so depressing. Ambiance was also just not for me, but great service. This was recommended to me by many locals so it was definitely worth the try.",2016-04-07 00:45:28

I've worked in the restaurant business in the past for over 10 years. I know everything from front and back of the house operations. Needless to say we were highly disappointed. From the service to the food, everything we had was sub par. We didn't have a waiter, so the bar tender had to give us service. He seemed to be in the weeds, so I gave him a pass since I know how that is sometimes. We sat on the balcony, which wasn't as nice as expected considering the tables and chairs were slanted. It was very uncomfortable, felt unsafe, and we had to constantly watch our drinks and food to make sure they didn't spill over. 

I started off with a half dozen of raw oysters, oyster duo and a Old Fashion cocktail. The raw oysters didn't taste as fresh as I've had at other places. The cocktail sauce or whatever they call it was nothing but ketchup with a side of horseradish. The ice chilling the oysters was halfway melted and was spilling over into my oysters. The oyster duo was a little better but the breading/stuffing was over powering the oyster. Way too much stuffing on them. After completing our appetizers I still had not received my cocktail which was around $12. Once received it was brought to me in a plastic cup you'd receive in some club, not in a rocks glass. I had to request a silverware replacement twice because there were noticeable food stains on my knife and forks. Now that I'm on the utensils, why would any self respecting restaurant serve their guests cheap, scratched utensils? Looks like they purchased them from Dollar General. The plastic drinking cups were gross as well. Your prices are not cheap but you put out cheap looking utentils? 

I ended up ordering the rib-eye and my wife had the crawfish ravioli. I ordered my rib-eye med, and it came out med-well. The potatoes were good, but my green beans were cold. If I'm paying almost $30 for a steak, I expect it to be cooked to my expectations. The ravioli wasn't impressive either. It tasted like something I could have gotten at Olive Garden. After all was said and done, we spent good money at this place and it was not well deserved. The royal house has a good menu, but they need a makeover in the front and back of the house.",2015-11-12 18:17:13
cbVM4fVP5ZDVHHZ5fAvKoQ,KM2cGnThcFKmM97h30B3VQ,VQcCL9PiNL_wkGf-uF3fjg,3,0,0,0,"Came here mainly for oysters as our last meal before leaving NOLA. We were seated upstairs right next to the balcony which was adorable! Super cute for an afternoon of people watching. The breeze did pick up during our lunch though so we ended up closing the doors next to our table. Initially I wanted to order a dozen raw oysters (1 dozen for $16) since one of my friends had never had oysters before, but the waitress told me they were known for their charbroiled oysters (1 dozen for $20) and I was sold. Definitely the highlight of our meal. I'm sure it wasn't anything special, but being from out of town, the Louisiana hot sauce that came out with the oysters was pretty good. I'll probably look for it the next time I go grocery shopping. 

As for the rest of our meal, I ordered the crawfish ravioli( $24)which was mouthwatering. The sauce was absolutely devine and it had a decent amount of crawfish chunks that made this dish an A in my book. My friends meals were not so much a hit. There was one order of the oyster pasta and two orders of the trio sampler (jambalaya, etouffee, and gumbo). The oyster pasta didn't taste like anything special and had fried oysters which i'm not a fan, but it wasn't bad by any means. As for the sampler, the jambalaya and gumbo were probably my least favorite of all the samples I tried throughout the weekend. None of us could pinpoint what the gumbo tasted like, but my friends didn't even finish their cup. The jambalaya was bland and did not stand out compared to all other options in the city. The Etouffee was quite tasty but only came in a small bowl alongside the other disappointing sample bowls. 

Despite the nice atmosphere, unique balcony dining, bomb oysters, and my cheesy ravioli, this place gets stars knocked off for the terrible service that we received at the table. First off, the waitress started off greeting our table by letting us know that they didn't do split checks, either cash or 1 card. Which was fine, except we clearly saw other tables get split checks, and honestly, its not that hard to do. When we went to order our food I wanted to ask her a quick question about the Yelp deal for 1 free appetizer since I saw it while checking in. As soon as I mentioned it she shook her head and stared at me like I was an idiot, stating that all deals were off for all restaurants around the area for the days leading up to Mardi Gras. False, we literally used a deal the night before coincidentally and the waitress there was great. And as if she couldn't leave it alone after I said it was alright, she again shook her head at me and told me how busy it was for Mardi Gras weekend. What. The. Hell. I get it. Move on. Our food also took a decent amount of time to come out, but we were also extra impatient because we were starving so the wait time might be an exaggeration. But it felt like forever. By the time it was time to pay for the bill our waitress reiterates again how they only accept 1 card on the check, after already giving us the non-split one check. Then comes back and gives us ""advice"" on how we pay the tip in cash if we didn't want to put it all on the card. Come on lady, the more that you talk, the less tip you're getting. It's like she thought this was our first time eating at a restaurant. Granted, we were a table of young women in our twenties, but plenty capable of paying for a meal. This has honestly got to be one of worst service experiences of my life. But I won't speak for the entire staff, the host that greeted us in front of the restaurant was extremely friendly.

Thanks to Yelp I've been finding all of the sweet spots in the French Quarter . I came across Royal House looking for something with a bistro feel and this place is right on target. 

Venue: The venue is a small 2 story bistro on the corner of Royal Street. You can either sit upstairs on the balcony, inside at the various 2-tops with the street view, at the small inside dining area or the actual Oyster Bar. This place has a vintage yet modern feel. Looks the the interior is old but kept up very well. The seats are comfy and this place isn't crowded. 

Service: Our server greeted us relatively quickly btw I loved the staff's attire. Our server got our drink order in quickly and honored our Yelp Free Appetizer.

Food: Holy moly New Orleans!? Lol...wow...this is legit the best place to have a meal in the French Quarter hands down. Our meal started off with Crawfish Cakes in a cream sauce as an appetizer which were so flavorful and cooked to perfection. For my entree I ordered the Oyster Pasta and my friend ordered the Shrimp Tortellini. Both were exceptionally prepared and full of flavor.

Overall: I highly recommend this place on your must visit list in New Orleans. You won't be disappointed!!",2014-07-06 04:18:51

Service: We were seated without reservations right away on a weekday night. Super slow service, we spent about 2.5 hours here, mostly waiting. 

Food: Both the hubby & I ordered the fried shrimp & fish platters & we waited 1 hour...for fried dishes!!! Both came out lukewarm to cold. Garlic mashed potatoes that came out with it were flavorless & just not good, not even a hint of salt. Shrimp was not even close to crispy & cold. Hubby said fish was just ok. We got a measly piece of French bread & the French fries were mushy and again, cold. The only good thing was the side dish of corn maque choux, but again barely lukewarm. 

Drinks: Our server, Diego said they're known for their Hurricanes, ordered one & nope, every Hurricane I've had in my life tasted better than that one. At $10 each, just stuck with water after that. 

The one star is for our server Diego who noticed the hubby's discontent with the food & sent the manager over to make things better. Manager insisted on giving us free dessert. Opted for the bananas foster cheesecake which WAS really good & the high point of our meal, but once again we waited about 40 minutes for it, we were literally about to walk out because we thought they had forgotten about it. 

Overall: Just bad. Super slow service, bad food & bad drinks. Wouldn't even consider giving them a second chance, too many other good options around the French Quarter for far cheaper prices.",2015-03-26 03:04:07

The étouffée was my favorite, but my brother who ordered the same thing said it tasted like it came out of a Campbell's can. The gumbo was just horrible. I've had some great gumbo before and this was far from it. It tasted like old gravy, didn't even have the flavor or meat of normal gumbo. The rice was bleh, dry and tasteless. My mother got the fried oyster pasta and thought it was average as well. I tried it and although I thought that it had a nice airy, light taste, it needed some salt and pepper. Everything here is just very one-note, not much development of flavor. The service was also average. Took a long time to get our food and it was a Monday night, not even that busy. We were waiting so long that we asked for some bread to hold us over. They looked surprised & they brought out some bread that (like everything else) was tasteless.

We were promptly seated by a very nice waiter. I asked for suggestions and his answer was seafood pescatore. Not too surprised it was one of the most expensive menu options, but I went with his word and ordered it. 

Food took a reasonable time to come out. The place seemed well staffed, something I always appreciate. 

I was deeply disappointed when right on top were two empty mussel shells. Not only that, there was a closed off clam shell as well. I can look past this to a point, but was surely disappointed. Not only that, but there were shell bits throughout the bowl. Ouch!! I won't discredit the taste of the pasta though. The sauce had a nice heat and I really enjoyed it. 

My colleagues ordered gumbo that didn't come with a spoon. Uncertain if that was intentional or not. They both ordered the alligator bites and thought they were just okay, required the cocktail sauce it came with. 

The waiter started to lose our love for him as the lunch went on. He kind of disappeared. He offered me a refill and never brought it. My colleague requested more sauce and he never brought it. We asked twice for a split bill and he still delivered one check.

She couldn't say no but we could tell she didn't want us to. I work food service and retail too so if it was that serious, I would just have said the kitchen is closed or the order can't be placed.

Found on Yelp. 

This was my first full day going into the night in NOLA. Me and my friend wanted to try a few things so we got some Jumbaliah (I'm sure I spelled that wrong), we got 3 kinds and I got some seafood pasta.

We also checked-in on Yelp and with 2 meal orders got a free appetizer. I believe it was called crab claws and came with some bread. The sauce was amazing, I wanted more!!! It was recommended to us as well.

The mild Jumbaliah was my favorite as I don't do super spicy to well. But my friend loved my pasta cause it was spicy but still delicious for me too.

We got a couple drinks and a couple beers. The drinks were strong but had a great taste to them. I got the Hurricane, wanted something fresh to start the day. Great choice.

The mood in the restaurant was great, modern, felt fresh, but still had that NOLA vibe. When I get back to NOLA I'm coming back here.

Also, the bartender/chef recommend some other places to check out and wrote them down for us. Great service",2013-06-14 17:56:52

The wait to be seated was 40 minutes, but reasonable considering we had no reservations and there was both a festival and conference occurring that weekend. The host was very understanding and accommodating.

Soon we were seated upstairs. The décor was warm and classic with glittering chandeliers. Several couples tables were located on the balcony. Quite a lovely place to be while vacationing in NOLA. Vintage and charming. 

Service was average. We were kindly offered two complementary appetizers via Yelp check-in considering there were 11 of us who waited quite awhile. However, the food came out incredibly slow overall. It took an hour for appetizers to arrive and another 30 minutes for entrees. Our soft drinks also took 30+ minutes because the restaurant ran out of ice. 

For appetizers, my friends and I shared the baked oyster duo, French onion soup, and redfish beignets. The oysters duo included the oysters Rockefeller--topped with spinach & bacon and to a baked golden brown, and the oysters Royale--topped with a bubbly seafood bake. Both were fine but unmemorable. The French onion soup was standard. The redfish beignets, recommended by our server, were fried golden brown fish filets served with sweet beurre blanc and powdered sugar. They tasted exactly as they sound and A-OK. 

For entrees, many of us ordered the crawfish ravioli which was highly recommended by the server. Unfortunately, the dish was loaded with green and red pepper chunks which overwhelmed the other flavors. It definitely was not the rich, savory crawfish ravioli dish we had been expecting. 

The other half of our party ordered raw oyster platters. Unfortunately, they came out quite late. We could not all enjoy our meal together due to the poor timing. I don't prefer raw oysters but they were reportedly delicious, although I imagine hard to mess up. 

Overall, the food was average and the only true problem was the very slow kitchen. We would probably only return here for drinks or shucked oysters.",2014-04-28 07:16:48

Everything was a OK. Nothing too special about any of them. The pasta noodles were too soggy. The oyster on the po boys are mostly coated with the breading, hardly any oysters. Artichoke dip was ""soupy"". French fries were warm and soggy. They seemed to be pre-cooked and waiting to be served. Charboiled oysters were not impressive. ACME still has the best one so far.

because i'd had the most amazing and filling dinner earlier in the night, i could only muster up the space to order a couple appetizers to share: hush puppies + fried alligator.

the hush puppies were really good!! mix anything fried with tartar sauce, and i'm in heaven.

the fried gator was just average in my opinion, kinda like eating tough, chewy chicken nuggets. i think that speaks more to the nature of fried gator, than to the quality of royal house as a restaurant.

the service is excellent and the restaurant has a nice ambiance to it. but looking around, the portions seemed a tad small for the prices.

Delicious! Ordered the Rockefeller oysters shrimp platter and a sampler of étouffée, jambalaya, and gumbo.

Shrimps  in the platter we're HUGE! Tastely breaded and fried to golden perfection. Also the hush puppies and fries were superb!! The cole slaw was heavy on the mayo but and also had apple added in the slaw.

CrAw fish Étouffée was soooooooo delicious the sauce everything about it was lip smacking good! Would come back and order the étouffée dish for sure.

Due to reading other yelp reviews, I already knew I wanted the french onion soup, so when I realized he wasn't going to acknowledge me after 10 minutes of waiting awkwardly I finally waved to catch his attention and asked to order the soup. He then finally asked if I needed a drink, and I inquired what non-alcoholic options were offered. Instead of answering my question he turned away to speak to someone else and ignored me. A minute later he passed me the drink menu (which had no non-alcoholic drinks on it) but he never checked back on me to see what I wanted. This was the only menu I received the whole time I was there. I wanted to leave because I felt so awkward being totally ignored by someone who was standing 6 inches away. I regretted that I had already ordered the soup otherwise I would have walked out. The cook who dropped off my food actually asked me if I needed anything else and seemed surprised when I said ""yes, a soda please"". He returned promptly with it.

I suggested they substitute the snow crab, but the waiter tells me that would rip us off as lobster is way more expensive then snow crab.  He then says we should order the snow crab plate and get a pound of peel and eat shrimp.  We get the bill and the snow crab plate with peel and eat shrimp is over $10 more then if we had just substituted crab for the lobster in their peel and eat shrimp.  Could not help but feel we got screwed.  Also- dont get the royal sauce for your po boy- its like $5 for sauce and they dont tell you.

If there is any deficiency at this place, we haven't found it yet. It's unlikely you will unless you come at a megabusy time of the year when no one gets good service anywhere in the Quarter.

Our last time at this premiere location was assisted by Donald behind the bar who handled both drinks and shucking oysters deftly. It shows when one has spent a long time working hard to please the customer. He accomplished that and more.

If you get lucky and can grab a seat out in the balcony and not freeze or sweat to death, this is the place to be. You can see the parades, listen to live music, throw some beads, or just people watch while enjoying a good meal.

Check in on Yelp and get a free appetizer (up to $10) when you order two entrees! Note: the raw oysters don't count as an entree but if you order a dozen of the Chargrilled Oysters this counts as an entree.

Food: 4 stars
- Raw Oysters ($16): really good...smaller than Acme and Luke's
- Combo of 3 Rockefeller Oysters and 3 Oysters Royale: AMAZING! The Rockefeller was baked with sautéed spinach and bacon. The Royale was stuffed and baked with seafood (yummm!). My favorite non raw oysters in New Orleans!
- Jambalaya topped with Blackened Shrimp ($18): good, but Acme is a lot more flavorful. The jambalaya here was a bit dry
- Eggplant and Oyster ($19): really good but very heavy. Fried eggplant and oysters over linguine and alfredo and marinara with veggies

Service and Wait Time: 2 stars
- Our server was very sweet and kept checking up on us so that was great but...
- We waited probably around 20 minutes to receive our raw oysters and then another ~30-35 minutes to receive our entrees. It wasn't even a packed house and another table of two that arrived he exact same time as us received their entrees and finished them before we received our entrees
- There were empty tables ready for customers but the restaurant still made people wait outside in line (if there's a line, people will be drawn to it!). This was not cool!

We were unable to sit upstairs outside as there were 6 of us, and they're only in tables of 2. It's a cute restaurant, with a large bar in the front, and areas where people can sit in twos while looking out at the street and people watch.

Our waitress recommended the honey Jack Daniels with lemonade, and since I'm a huge fan of Jack Daniels, I had to try. It's sweet, but not overbearingly sweet, but I couldn't taste the alcohol at all, or feel it? Although there must have been some as my friend had the asian glow afterwards. 

We ordered 4 different types of oysters. A dozen raw, half a dozen of the rockefeller, a dozen of the chargrilled, and oysters royale.

The raw oysters had a saltier taste than others, more brimey, and I found a mini pearl as I was eating one, or chewed on it and thought maybe I broke a tooth. Nice little souvenier, nor did I know you could find pearls in oysters!

The oysters rockefeller was dissapointing. It was just a baked bready oyster, and I was thinking it would be like the chargrilled, but with spinach and herbs. Not what I had expected at all. The royale was the same, but more seafoody. The chargrilled oysters, you can't go wrong with all the butter and garlic and parmesean cheese. Yum!

My friend's gumbo was tasty, and the seafood portofino had a great sauce. My alligator po boy was okay, not the greatest, but the fries were coated in this extra batter that was pure deliciousness.

Reason for 3 stars is the raw oysters were our least favorite out of the 4 places we've tried, and service was lackluster. Very slow, and we were in a rush to get to the airport.",2012-03-27 20:26:12

Their ""signature"" Hurricanes are terrible compared to the real thing but the Bloody Mary's are alright though not spicy compared to others in the city.  Fish and chips are enough to split, hush puppies are good (when they are warm), and oysters are large.  They hurry you through which is why the wait is short.  The best thing about RH is the discount for locals.  An easily fixable maintenance issue needs to be addressed by RH.  All three times we have been there, one of the toilets in the ladies room has been out of order, overflowing or running.  Just generally broken.

Our waiter's service was exceptional, but due to a miscommunication with other servers, we ended up staying an additional 40-50 minutes in order to sort out our order. What occurred was that we could not have our seafood pot because they had run out of lobster, so we asked if we could have a crab seafood pot instead. Rather than confirming with us, they said they had an idea of what we wanted and brought us a plate of Alaskan crab (which was not what we wanted). We had to send this one back and ask for an entirely different order since the one we wanted may have been a bit complicated. Additionally, we ordered 'The Taste of New Orleans' in our initial order, but never received it. Upon notification, our server placed the order in, having us wait another 20-25 minutes just for that order (my poor, hungry parents have been waiting for about an hour by then). We only received this order when we personally had to ask about its whereabouts. By then it was barely warm. Furthermore, we had ordered a SIDE of jambalaya, but they gave us an entire entree instead. We ate it unaware that it was, thus was charged for it.
In the end, when we received our check, we were charged for a seafood pot we never received ($50), an order that was way bigger than we even asked for, and an additional coke.

Nothing was overly spicy which was kind of nice since we were able to add hot sauce as required ;-) The staff was friendly and the service was good too.

We were encouraged when we walked in to sit at the bar, upon doing so she was rude and uninterested in us or being at work in general. She shucked oysters behind the bar and sprayed their juices in front of our plates. We ordered an appetizer and a meal she forgot the meal and just gave us our appetizer. The stuffed mushrooms were delicious, only reason I gave this a two star. I was flabbergasted by her lack of attentiveness and attitude toward paying customers. Also she used her dirty oyster shucking gloves to grab the ice scooped out of the bin of ice and scooped another customers ice for water with the dirty gloves in the ice so I took that second star I gave for the mushrooms away because of this!

The younger gentleman greeting outside was actually pretty hilarious.  We were dressed as doctors for Halloween and his opening line was something like, ""You doctors want some greasy unhealthy food to start your morning?"", pretty hilarious, of course, we wanted alchohol instead, but it got us in the door, know your clientele I guess.

The place is clean and I liked the white tiling and dark wood decor. It was a nice, cool respite from the heat. Seemed like a place frequented by locals too, dining in and ordering to go, which is usually a good sign. Never had to wait for a seat. 

For the food we had the sautéed crab claws (in a to die for sauce), oysters raw, charbroiled and the oyster duo (Rockefeller and Royalel), royal spinach salad, alligator bites, and the tomato mozzarella ""salad"" which was basically a caprese. Of all items the caprese was my least favorite, as there were giant slices of raw red onion between the tomatoes/mozzarella, and it was drenched in what tasted like a basic balsamic vinegarette dressing. I'd have preferred no onions and a healthy drizzle of balsamic, and also basil. We also had some great hurricanes here, which were made with fresh/real ingredients rather than mixes. Yum!

I chose Royal House because of it's pretty good review on Yelp and the food was, in fact, pretty good!  We were seated near the windows which made for great weekend people watching and our server was friendly, upbeat and more than happy to assist what was probably her millionth tourist of the night.  With my Yelp checkin I received a free appetizer of up to $10 which really covered only one appetizer, spinach dip.  That's right, spinach dip at a seafood restaurant.  No thanks!  We inquired about the other apps on the menu and she stated that we could cover any amount over the $10 limit, which we agreed to do and ordered the crab claws.  Because we were splitting the bill (thanks to the corporate credit card) the amount would be charged to my card but half of the discount would go to me and half would go to my mom.  Weird.  The claw tips were good, small, and served in a delicious ""calorie conscious"" lemon garlic butter sauce with toasted french bread for dipping.  The french bread wasn't exactly fresh, and the claws were exactly meaty, but it was good for a free app.  For dinner I ordered the jambalaya with grilled shrimp and my mom ordered the shrimp po boy.  The shrimp were large and cooked perfectly while the jambalaya was flavorful but lacking the spice I had hoped for.  My mom said her po boy was delicious and more flavorful than others she had while in town.  Although our server was great about refills in the beginning, she totally disappeared towards the end of the meal.  It seemed like we waited at least 20 minutes after we finished eating to get our bill, and then quite some time after we set out our cards to complete the transaction.  It wasn't overly busy so I couldn't really figure out what the holdup was!  Overall it was a good meal in a historic building with a nice view of the oyster bar.

My wife and I were immediately drawn to the prospect of balcony dining, and although quite narrow, it totally satisfied our tourist-y desire to suck down oysters on the half shell while overlooking the historic streets of the French Quarter.  Sadly, I was pretty surprised/disappointed with the etouffee, my only prior experience from Da Levee in Columbus, which pretty much set me up for failure.  Here, it was unremarkably bland--or should that be remarkably bland?  Whatever, it was bland, and not the flavor blast of soulful comfort in my mouth I had been hoping for and remembered from Da Levee.  On a happier note, my wife's ravioli were much more satisfying (the sauce was comparatively delicious).

The real treat here appears to be their fried platters and po' boy monstrosities.  When i spied our fellow balcony diners' fried platters, I briefly envisioned the proverbial straw that breaks the camel's back--here, I guess that'd be the fried shrimp that makes the balcony go all Mexican soccer stadium.

We had an almost identical experience to a previous reviewer. We left the parade, party of nine, and made our way down here with a Restaurant.com certificate. 

Took us ages to be seated; we watched one of the ""head shuckers"" take a beer order for a couple of guys and serve them, but largely ignored us. When we tried to place an order for a drink, he sent us to the other end of the bar putting us squarely in the way of every waiter and waitress trying to get by with a tray. Nice. 

When we were finally seated, the service was painfully slow. Everyone at the table got their meal except for me; like 20 minutes of waiting without a plate. It was just as well, since everyone who was picking at their food said it was freezing like it was sitting on the counter forever. Gummy cold fries, etc. 

When my meal finally came out, it was a shrimp po boy (not the oyster one I ordered) but I was too starving to care. I plowed through it even though the shrimp was cold and had obviously been out of the fryer for a while. 

Our waitress was missing for very long intervals so it was nearly impossible to place a drink order. It looked like they had her working two sections and the other one was down a long flight of stairs, so I don't blame her for their inability to properly staff the restaurant and cook food for a large party while still keeping it hot. We ordered *sandwiches* for pete's sake. Even if you're slammed, you should be able to bring out sandwiches and hot fries in under 2 hours. 

Not only was nothing comped, (and I NEVER ask for that sort of thing, but somewhat expect a place to extend an olive branch if the service or food was an embarrassment)  we were considerably OVERcharged and had to send the bill back to be corrected. 

An all around disappointment.

I was happy to find a highly reviewed restaurant open on a federal holiday so I spent my thanksgving dinner at Royal House. This restaurant is located in the French Quarter so parking is very hard to find but you can always pay for parking at various garages in the area and walk over. There was a short line on this night but out wait was only about 15 minutes. 

I was looking forward to the chargrilled oysters since this is a New Orleans specialty. I've had it this dish before at two other very highly reviewed restaurants in the French Quarter. I was very disappointed in Royal House's version of chargrilled oysters for one very important reason: size. A dozen oysters was 20 dollars so this dish does cost quite a bit so I expected some juicy oysyers but the size of each specimen was disappointingly about the size of an almond. I've never seen chargrilled oysters so small and all 24 of the ones we had were all tiny. The competition in the french quarter served oysters that quadrupled the size for the same price and in the same season as I visited those restaurants on the following night. 

We also ordered the blackened redfish, chicken sandwich, redfish beignet, and oyster pastry. The highly revered blackened redfish was ok, nothing too special. The chicken sndwich was ok. The oyster pastry and redfish beignet were very unique and tasty. The redfish beignet was covered in a sweet sauce. The shell was very crispy. Unlike a typical beignet which is square and has a dough filling, the redfish beignet was a long and slim rectangle with a fish filling. The oyster pastry was small but very tasty. 

There is a yelp check in offer for a free appetizer. No stipulations were mentioned on the yelp page for check in but our server informed us that we would only get a 10 dollar credit and that we needed to order two entrees. The chargrilled oysters do not count as an entree even though the cost exceeds many other qualified entrees and by a huge amount on some selections. I don't undetstand this logic. 

Two stars overall for this establishment. The price doesn't justify the experience.",2015-11-28 08:21:05
rdF7awv3Q1QZX_gCHABTOg,1dFC0YhcvFu1ibPVYTkEfA,VQcCL9PiNL_wkGf-uF3fjg,4,3,0,2,"I visited Royal House for dinner on a weekday in May. It is not a very large place and seating was fairly limited.  But nothing special was happening in New Orleans that week and the crowds were very light.  I was seated immediately by a window next to the bar.

The waiter was very pleasant and he got us started with drinks.  I had read about the Bloody Mary's , so I had to have one.  It was very tasty and perfectly seasoned for my taste.  I don't like it when they just taste like hot sauce.

The spicy tomato drink went well with the appetizers that we had.  The crawfish cakes, crab claws and charbroiled oysters were all very good.   In fact the charbroiled oysters were so good I went back the next day for more before going out for drinks.  I highly recommend them.  They are much better than oysters Rockefeller which I had always liked.
 
When I checked in on Yelp I was pleasantly surprised to see a check-in offer for a free appetizer.  (Thus the third appetizer when there were only two of us.)  Unfortunately, they would have been better off not offering it because it was the cause of the only problem I had with the place.  At first the waiter had to go and check with the manager to determine if I met some qualifications for redeeming the offer.  The later when the bill came, the discount had not been applied.  With the trouble I had to go through to get the offer in the first place, I wasn't going to let this slide so I asked the waiter to try again.  The bill was finally corrected.  I don't know if it was the manager or the waiter to blame for this, but it tarnished an otherwise good experience.

My entrees were also delicious.  I don't remember exactly what I ate, but my notes said that I like it a lot.

So overall, the food was very good and the service was mostly good.  I would definitely go back to Royal House.",2012-07-14 12:58:25

This time, not so much. We showed up at around 9:15, after a wonderful hour of music at the Preservation Hall. My 9 year old was starving.

He was on his way back, with no intention of stopping at our table, when we stopped him and ask him politely to take our order because we are waiting for a long time and our daughter was starving. Well, I guess he didn't like us complaining, because 30 min after our food was not yet on the table. People around us ordered and finished.

My oysters were burned and dry, and instead of the nice toast that comes with it, there was this old piece of bread, lonely and cold.

We walked down Royal to grab lunch before leaving for the airport. The concierge at the Ritz recommended that we sit upstairs on the balcony at Royal House as it allowed us to watch people walking on the street - great suggestion!

One negative about that idea: being on the street means that drinks MUST be served in plastic cups, not optimal for drinking wine.  However, it stands to reason given the fact that it is New Orleans, with lots of alcohol flowing.

For starters, I ordered half dozen oysters and my husband ordered a cup of the seafood gumbo. Hmmmm  - his soup showed up and my oysters did not. When we asked, we were told that the waitress had to order the oysters from the bar (versus kitchen) and for some reason, she had asked them to delay delivery. I'm not sure why she thought that I wanted to wait to eat my oysters.

I then had the Taste of New Orleans, cups of Crawfish etoufee, jambalaya and chicken and sausage gumbo.  One word for them all - meh. I'm not an expert at New Orleans food but they were pretty bland and all seemed to taste somewhat the same. ...and then the oysters showed up.

I fired up the Yelpmobile and did a quick search, the likes and intensity of which only a true Yelper knows.  I punched in my secret codes for filtering out lesser places and for maximum effect I added the double secret passphrase.

The Yelpmobile spit out the Royal House.  It was awesome because we were near Jackson Square at the time, so it was super close.  Oddly, I see another review that says there was a free app for checking in.  I didn't get that.

The waitress did her best to be as helpful and as upbeat as she could, but nothing could save this terrible experience. 

DO. NOT. ORDER. THEIR. POBOYS. EVER.
EVER.
They were easily THE worst thing I had the misfortune of placing into my mouth while in NOLA. I'm pretty sure I've had food that was possibly slightly spoiled that was better than that garbage atrocity of a sandwich. 
Just thinking about it infuriates me. 

Chargrilled Oysters are NOT chargrilled. No wood is involved. They are cooked on their gas stove and then smothered to absolute hypertension induced death with Parmesan, which, when combined with the existing brine of the oysters themselves, equate to salt on top of salt. Terrible doesn't quite describe the experience with justice.

As for the raw oysters, they were old, with no movement at all when lemon was spritzed over them. The waitress had never heard of mignonette sauce and was surprised I asked for something she knew nothing about (I'm pretty sure I was more surprised at her surprise than she was). 
You're better off skipping these too.

The crab claws were salty and tiny, average at best. The toast that came with it were microwaved to oblivion, more of like a gigantic stale breadcrumb than any kind of toast I've ever had.

The prominent flavor profile at Royal House is salt, to the point of where I wonder if the kitchen staff all had terrible colds that annihilated their tastebuds.

My crawfish etouffee was the only reason why I give them 0.5 stars more, but in all honesty, almost anything would have been better than the fiasco listed above. (as in, I would rather eat at Mcdonald's than eat here again) The sauce of the etouffee was pretty tasty, but the fried crawfish were disgusting. As a matter of fact, if you see anything fried on their menu, avoid it like you avoid that awkward clingy ""friend"" that you happen to see at social gatherings. Quickly, with zero hesitation, and no remorse. 
If you have a business engagement that requires you to eat here, then go with their grilled seafood options, or get the crawfish etouffee with extra crawfish instead of fried crawfish. 

Actually, just do yourself a favor and avoid this restaurant altogether. You're better off eating at Cochon or Cochon butcher again.",2015-09-30 18:22:50

These cost more too - 10 dollars.  Served in a cheap plastic cup made to look like a real glass.  I saw them make one.  They have a dispenser that sets at the bar with an olive infused liquid they put directly into the drink.  I didn't get a pic but they granted me permission to use a photo from their website.  It's on the left of the oyster pic-- looks like a water cooler with olives in it.

They charbroiled oysters were very good.  Perhaps better than the Crazy Lobster's.  These were simple with  butter, Parmesan and sea salt.  Went well with the Bloody Mary.  

I should have gotten a real meal but fried food is my one true love. It didn't disappoint but I found myself longing for something green... like the one the seafood salads.  Husband got a nice meal and he commented more than once how much he enjoyed his pan seared salmon and veggie dish.  

The waiter was helpful and friendly.  He brought me water to go with my drink without me having to request it (actually less common than you would think).  The seating was comfortable and well spaced.  Didn't feel too crowded, even though there were a lot of people there. 

Spent more than I expected the meal to be but I dropped 20 bucks on Bloody Marys alone.  Aww well, I feel it was worth it.",2010-04-22 16:13:20

Crawfish Ravioli 2/5 - dry and chewy. Most flavor came from the tomato sauce, with some texture of crawfish. I prefer Trader Joe lobster ravioli.....

We started off with Grilled Oysters. Not just any grilled oysters, but these babies are smothered in butter with garlic and parmesan cheese. The world
literally ends when you put these babies in your mouth. Then there's the Gator Po Boi. If there was any unique sandwich for you to try here in New Orleans, it would be Gator. If you're not so adventurous... There's a McDonald's 5 blocks down the street,, I'm sure they serve chicken nuggets and french fries there... Last, but not the least the Crawfish Etoufee,  yummy crawfish goodness smothered all over a bed of rice. Yes it's my favorite and yes I am in food heaven whenever I eat this dish.

Service:
Royal House service was top notch. All servers were friendly and knowledgeable about the subtle differences in menu items. Smiles abound and great conversation about New Orleans and local hangs to find.

Taste:
Oysters came out in full flavor. The Rockefeller oysters were very filling and satisfying. If you are hungry from a day of strolling around and looking for some tasty apps and entrees, the Royal House will deliver.

Dietary Accommodations:
Seafood, seafood, seafood! Sound good? The Royal House may not specifically  offer gluten free or vegan options but once again, not sure why a vegan would go to a seafood place? Rest assure though, they have a selection of salads to satisfy the pallet and a lot of naturally gluten free options. A little something for everyone.

Atmosphere:
The Royal House offers its patrons a charming throwback to the 1700s with an upscale feel. 

Balcony: sounds of the hustle bustle from below: some music, traffic, and people. Great views. Great place to unwind after a heavy day of tourism and to prepare you for the nighttime festivities.

Overall Experience:
For starters, I received a free app for checking in with yelp. Not sure if this is always offered but it's worth ""a check-in.""
My friend and I had a great experience. The balcony views were great, the servers were all super friendly and the food was refreshingly good. Give them a try if you're in town.",2018-06-05 22:58:12

Jambalaya was dry and lacking flavor, mostly mushy rice with dry overcooked chicken mixed with a decent andouille.

With all the other amazing food choices in New Orleans, I felt cheated out of a good meal that night based on the high reviews here.   It's probably more 2 stars, but I'm giving it a 1 to balance out too many 5 star reviews.

The platter of food he pointed to was tantalizing and I just couldn't say no.  My mind was made and I took my date's hand and sat down for a sinfully delicious dinner at Royal Oyster House, without even a thought about my husband.

My dinner date (my mom!) and I started off with the Chicken and Sausage Gumbo (delicious, very rich and creamy and probably made with lots lard).

Our party of 3 (later joined by a 4th) lucked out and was seated upstairs very close to the patio...perfect since it was inside so the threatening rainclouds didn't really worry us, but close enough to the outside that we were able to enjoy the gorgeous, misty evening view and air.  I think the downstairs is much more casual, but the upstairs area really made for a beautifully lit and romantic atmosphere in quaint a New Orleans house (although none of my dinner companions were mah boo :-P). The food was good, although I only got raw oysters and wine, which is all I wanted.  Oysters were fresh and good sized, shucked correctly.

The service, though, was veeeerrrry inexperienced.  In her defense, she was this pixie-haired maybe 22-yr old sweet girl that just did not know what she was doing. We ended up getting bottles of wine, and for whatever reason, we realized after the second glass that she was FILLING our glasses to the brim, i.e. y'know how a wine pour is only perhaps 1/3 of the glass, maybe a 1/2 if someone is generous?  She was pretty much pouring them to the very top of the glass...and it wasn't to give us more wine since we'd already bought the whole bottle.  And when we asked her to pour smaller pours for the second bottle, she was a little miffed/confused as to why.  *sigh*  A bit flighty, but again, I just chalk it  up to inexperience.  We had to ask for water.  She would drop things, like the silverware, when she tried to collect things off our table. Very sweet and smiley though.

They present themselves as an ""oyster bar"" which is why we went in, though one of my group ordered a blackened chicken sandwich. He said it was mediocre and tasted like 'overpriced bar food.' The other two of us ordered 'fresh Louisiana oysters' and it was not good. First, they don't scrub their oysters. I had silt, goop and muck all over my fingers by the time I finished a half dozen. Putting your mouth up to a dirty oyster shell that came from God knows where is troubling enough, let alone thinking about what manner of aquatic monsters might have come along with it. Beyond that, once shucked, the silt ran into the oyster juice making for a lot of grittiness in your mouth, equally unappealing. Other surprising finds: they shucked oysters but threw out the wrong side of the shell, usually you present the oyster in the deeper ""cup"" not the flatter top shell but several of these came presented incorrectly. One of the oysters had a dark, hard chunk visible to the eye (maybe the beginnings of a pearl? I have no idea WTF it was) and after trying to surgically remove it I told the server I'd like a different one.

On a side note, I'm used to ocean oysters and I assume these come from a river (or delta) however I've never had oysters with other mollusks growing on the shells - typically you want oysters that come from an area with a healthy exchange of water to deliver nutrients to the oysters. Having other sealife attach and thrive on the oyster shell implies they're not grown in an area of free moving water.

Last note about this place, the server was very inattentive. I think this might just be a New Orleans thing as everyone seems to operate on ""island time"" (for those of you who travel to the Caribbean and know what I mean): it gets done when we get it done and there is no sense of urgency. The couple at the table next to us took over an hour just to get their food and waited 30 more minutes to try to get the check. Overall, miserable place.",2016-11-05 05:06:47

Po' Boy on excellent bread loaded with perfect oysters where the oystery goodness was augmented not drowned by the crispy fry coating. 
Accompanied by the only grilled oysters we ever found in NOLA that came with just a hint of real, fresh grated (as in strands) cheese on top. Applied with restraint and respect. Every other green-can-parmesan abused oyster we had afterwards was just a sad reminder that the Royal House does it right.

They really need to take a clean rag and clean the place. This place does not deserve 4 stars. I can't trust yelp after this! 

I ordered a bottle of wine (""Riesling""), fried alligator, raw oysters, char-grilled oysters, blackened redfish with crab meat. 

Fried alligator- You cannot chew through the meat. It is so incredibly tough and full of muscle. Not sure why people serve this. I chewed for a good 2 minutes and spit it out. 

Raw oysters- Not flavorful. Just average oysters. 

Char-grilled oysters- you taste the parmesan cheese with oyster texture. Was tasty. 

Blackened redfish with crab meat- The blacked fish was good. Pub quality. However, the green beans were canned green beans and considering the dish cost $30 I would expect fresh green beans. Also the crab meat on top was not fresh!!

And boy were we glad! We added our name to this list and anxiously awaited for our name to be called so we can get some good food! 

We waited only like 20mins (thank God!) and we were seated... Upstairs, like ROYALty! :) (see what I did there?! Lol) As soon as we got seated, the most pleasant and amazing server, September, came over to help us. She was so wonderful and extremely informative and helpful with our ordering, and also recommended delicious entree options. Of course, when you're traveling out of state, you ALWAYS take the servers recommendation -- and September was awesome! She recommended the Crawfish Ravioli (which I ended up ordering and was absolutely finger-licking good), and the gumbo, and a few other dishes. 

To start, we went with Fried Alligator -- 'cause when in New Orleans, you GOTTA have 'gator. For entrees, we ordered the Shrimp Creole, Taste of New Orleans, and of course I ordered the Crawfish Ravioli.

When our food came, our mouths began salivating just from the smell. Once the food was on our table, all it took was one bite, and wowza -- our tastebuds were having a party of their own; all the flavors went together so nicely, with just the right touch of Cajun spiciness. It was incredible! So flavorful and tasty, absolutely finger-licking good (but don't worry, we ate with our utensils, not our fingers.) I, for one, had never had crawfish before either, and I almost ate the entire portion (couldn't though 'cause it was quite a lot of food.) I now understand why people LOVE Louisiana cookin'...

What then, might you ask, was I doing in an oyster house in the middle of New Orleans?  For the sake of love, of course. I had the opportunity to dine at Royal House for a friend's wedding reception and thoroughly enjoyed myself, regardless of the fact that I didn't ingest a single ounce of oysters.

Food: Royal House specializes in fresh oysters and seafood, but the menu also includes an assortment of non-surf appetizers, soups, salads, and entrees. A set buffet was offered for the reception that I attended, which included cheese, fruit, mini muffulettas, duck quesadillas, gumbo, and the restaurant's famed oysters. I found all the options to be fresh, well-prepared, and flavorful. Although I didn't try the oysters, they were literally flying off the tray immediately upon delivery, so I can only assume that they were perfectly delightful. 

Service: Every staff member, from the bartenders to the banquet staff, was personable, professional, and efficient. They were also fairly proficient at replenishing the dishes in a timely manner, particularly the oysters.  

Atmosphere: Royal House is located in a historic building in the heart of the French Quarter. The restaurant is located on two separate floors - the oyster bar occupies most of the first floor, while an additional dining room and outdoor patio are located on the second floor.  I was told by the staff that the restaurant that originally occupied this building, Tortorici's, frequently hosted Hollywood elites like Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin.

Cost: The regular food menu is moderately priced. Appetizers are $8-$11, soups and salads are $6-$13, po-boys and sandwiches are $10-$15, entrees are $15-$25, and desserts are $6-$8. Raw oysters are $7/half dozen and $12/dozen, while charbroiled oysters are $8/half dozen and $15/dozen.

Other: Hours of operation are Monday-Friday, 11AM-12AM, and Saturday-Sunday, 9AM-12AM. Breakfast is served on the weekends from 9AM-11AM. 18% gratuity is added to parties of 5 or more.",2012-05-23 01:16:29

Service was pretty quick and friendly.  My boyfriend and i had originally ordered the alligator poboy, blackened shrimp jambalaya, crab claws, and the oyster maque choux (6 in an order).  Sadly, our server told us that they were out of the crab claws and apologized.  We then quickly switched the appetizer to the fried alligator instead of the crab claws and got the fried catfish poboy instead of the alligator poboy.

the food came out quickly.  The oysters maque choux were like little corn chowders with a whole oyster served in the oyster shell.  if you like oysters and chowder, this is really good.  it was pipping hot and the shells retained the heat.  the fried alligator was like popcorn chicken with the texture of pork.  i have to say, it was pretty awesome.  not gamey at all like some other alligator meat  i have tried (in California of course).

For the entrees, the fried catfish sandwich was just that....a fried fish sandwich.  only complaint  i have is that the bread was a little too toasted, but the fish was fried perfectly.  The jambalaya with blackened shrimp was awesome in flavor and texture.  my biggest complaint is that  i do not understand why there were 3 slices of bread on the top and a pickled whole pepperoncini in the middle for garnish.  this was not necessary and it looked like they were just throwing stuff on the plate.

Overall, i liked it and was most impressed with the oysters (i like chowdah).  price is probably a little high but it is touristy, so it is to be expected",2013-06-14 00:08:56

I took my daughter here to celebrate her birthday, along with my father that I hadn't seen in a year. Our seating arrangement on the balcony was nice and the gentleman, Arrow, who sat us was an absolute delight. The rest was pretty upsetting. The menu description did not adequately describe my $24 pasta dish. It was smothered in flavor hindering cheese and when I asked for a side of corn for my 10 year old, noone mentioned it would be too pepper hot for even myself to eat. My dad ordered a $13 spicah salad and it was the size of a side salad and was limp.
I decided it was worth letting the manager know about the experience we were having so I went downstairs where the host was located to ask to speak to someone. Both the manager and the server took it upon themselves to chastise me for ""how"" I asked to speak with her and told me I should have just stayed upstairs in my seat and asked for her there. 
They took the meal (and the corn) off and that's fine, but I left hungry, having spent $90 plus a modest tip, and scorned.

We ordered crawfish etouffle (the best), redfish beignets, shrimp Creole, shrimp and grits, and jambalaya. Overall, the shrimp they used in the dishes were poor quality, small and dinky... wasn't that fresh. 

The crawfish etouffee was the best! Buttery and creamy, the savory sauce satisfies your taste buds immediately. 

Redfish beignets were good too! For some reason, I was expecting if to be 'redfish stuffed beignets,' but they were more like fried redfish with a small layer of beignet batter on the outside. Still delicious!

Jambalaya was mediocre for me, similar to other Jambalaya you can get in NOLA.

Shrimp n grits were tasty! The grits were in a more solid form than other grits I've had, and there was a nice crisp layer on the outside. :D mmmm crisp. 

Shrimp Creole was my least favorite... Just shrimp with tomato sauce... Reminded me of tomato pasta sauce with shrimp and rice. I would skip this dish.

They were able to take our group immediately and sat us by a window. It was a gorgeous day so they didn't have a problem opening large ceiling to wall window to let us enjoy the fresh air. 

We started with the fried gator bites for the group. Delicious! It was big enough for four of us to sample while still saving room for the rest of our food. 

The cocktails were also notable. I went with a berry martini followed up by a basil berry cocktail. I appreciated them at the time but I should have appreciated them more. They are a lovely change of pace from the touristy sweet stuff. They were strong but masked it well. 

I went with the Taste of New Orleans which consisted of the Chicken & Andouille Jambalaya, Crawfish Etouffée and Chicken and Andouille Gumbo. I enjoyed my meal, but to be honest all of these kind of tasted similar. There were only slight variations. I had some of these items at other places and they had much more flavor and distinction. There were so many more creative dishes like the Crawfish Ravioli, Baked Shrimp Tortellini and Shrimp Creole just to name a few. Plus, I tried a piece of my friend's crab claws and it was knock it out of the park amazing. I've never had crab claws before and didn't realize how easy they were to eat.

We're staying at the Omni and were looking for a place to grab a bite and have a chat with a friend. The location was so close, we figured we'd give it a try.

We really wanted to like this place. But what a horrible mistake we made by going here. The food was mediocre at best. The fried gator was lacking flavor. They might as well have breaded up and fried chicken strips. The waiter told us not to bother with the hush puppies, because they were frozen in a bag and not made fresh. The steaks were bland. A little seasoning would have done wonders.

But the service is why I'm writing. Listen, if I'm going to drop $100+ on a meal, I expect the wait staff to actually wait on the table. I don't expect to be kept waiting nearly 20 minutes before having someone come over to take first drink order.

And considering that my husband is in the food business, it was unbelievably insulting to have the waiter deliver a drink that was supposed to be a Crown Royal Whiskey on the rocks - and it wasn't. We're still not sure what it was, but it wasn't Crown - it had a strange rye-meets-rubbing-alcohol-or-some-sort-of-cleaner flavor and smell.

Now, these sorts of mistakes happen, and typically it's no big deal. Everyone's human, the room was packed, I get it.

But to have the waiter stand there, smile patronizingly at us and tell us that he had watched the bartender pour it - and that we were wrong...yeah, that was the topper.

Ordered shrimp and grits and blackened shrimp jambalaya. Both came out within 5 minutes of order, not nearly long enough to cook them fresh. Shrimp were fresh frozen and baby shrimp. Jambalaya was awful. It was so dry and flavorless. It left a chalky taste in your mouth and the shrimp were not even blackened. 

I love shrimp and grits and this was pile of greasy slop. 

But...I am giving them three stars because the way the waitstaff and manager handled the situation was fabulous. Brian, the manager, came over to talk to us and apologized profusely. He offered us different dishes which we declined due to timing. He comped our meal and made us feel very comfortable and appreciated as customers.

For the reason of the wait staff and Brian I am giving them 3 stars. If you go here would not try the dishes I listed. 

Glad they have great customer service. Sign of a good restaurant. Just may need a new chef.",2015-05-22 23:27:44

But first, the cocktails! The girls and I tried the Bloody Mary, Soco Mint Julep, and the Margarita. Those went down faster than our water. I tasted all three, and I would definitely order the Bloody Mary! Our table ordered the grilled chicken salad, catfish po boy, and I had the redfish beignets and seafood gumbo.

Overall, the food was good. My redfish beignets were great and a unique take on the original ones! I loved the sweet sauce that was drizzled over it, and I added some more Tabasco to add a little heat. While these beignets were a hit, my seafood gumbo was pretty bland. Nothing special, so I would move on and order something else. Friends enjoyed their meals, so either they were super hungry or they were as good as they said they were.

Given the busy-ness of the weekend, it was pretty tough to find a spot during the usual brunch hours, so this place was our last resort. I'd probably look elsewhere if it weren't for the longer wait times at other nearby establishments!",2013-05-02 03:07:09

We showed up starving around 11:30 for an early lunch before our flight. We were one of about 5 parties, so we pretty much had the place to ourselves. The restaurant is huge - large dining area and bar on both bottom and top levels, along with upstairs balcony seating! White tablecloths and nice place settings add to the classiness of the place, but you could still dress pretty casual here.

Every waiter/waitress interaction we had and witnessed at Royal House was pleasant - everyone was extremely friendly. I ordered the Crawfish Ravioli and my boyfriend had the Seafood Pescatore. All I can say is WOW. My ravioli was delicious - perfectly cooked pasta stuffed with ricotta cheese embedded in a creamy, spice-filled crab and crawfish sauce, with even more cheese on top. I was in heaven! My boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed his dish as well, but gobbled it down before I could snag a bite. His pasta was topped with plentiful seafood: scallops, mussels, clams, and shrimp, and tossed in a yummy red sauce.

I wish we could say we had room for dessert, but we will definitely be back to Royal House the next visit to the French Quarter and make sure to try their famous Bananas Fosters Cheesecake or Bread Pudding!",2016-09-17 22:48:19

We walked in and there was no one to seat us. A bar back yelled across the room that we could sit whereever we wanted. We chose a 4 top away from the draft of the door (it was cold!). My friend had never had fried alligator so we started with that and a bowl of seafood gumbo. Both were DELICIOUS!!! The alligator was a little chewy but Ive found that to be the case in more than one restaurant in my life. The entrees were both crawfish based and were super tasty. The drinks were good as well.

Visiting New Orleans we wanted a taste of some Louisiana shrimp with some Cajun spice to it.  We ordered one thing which was Cajun Peel-and-Eat shrimp.  The waitress came back with our order moderately fast.  
As far as the quality of our order of Peel-and-Eat shrimp: half of the shrimps were over-cooked (somewhat mushy behind the shell); the Cajun spices were way too salty;  the order was supposed to be served with corn-on-the-cobb and potatoes, but only came with potatoes (the waitress did not even mention why there wasn't any corn with the order, I had to point that out).  When the waitress finally came back with 1/2 of an ear of corn, she said ""sorry it was still boiling.""   The corn was soft and mushy on the outside and still frozen in the middle (cold!). 
Because of this experience, I wouldn't trust the freshness of their ingredients or bother to come back here again.  
I would give this one star if it wasn't for the decent response time by our waitress.",2013-06-22 05:37:34

I've walked by this place in the past and they never seem to have a wait.  Well, now I understand why...   Our server was the friendliest woman we had ever met but she was so slow to take our orders and our food arrived cold and she got all the orders wrong.   Everyone got some sort of bourbon or beer, so you can't go wrong with that, but I ordered a mint julep, and that was a mistake.  It arrived in a tall pilsner glass and I could not taste any liquor, let alone the mint!   This drink was pure sugar..should have been called the sugar julep!    Well, all four of us ordered the Shrimp Po-Boy, and I think they split their one batch of shrimp between 4 people.  These po'boys were (1) cold (2) incorrectly dressed (3) lacking in freshness, the bread was SO hard.   We substituted fries for 'red beans and rice, WHOA, big mistake, this was definitely not the best or even good red beans and rice.

I followed this with a Crab Louie salad, which was OK. My mistake for not realizing the crab was breaded and fried; while it was delicious, it was an odd combination with the cold salad.

For the appetizer we ordered the oyster duo. It took 2 minutes for it to come out of the kitchen, and it sure looked like they only spent that long making it. The oysters were dry and definitely not fresh. I've never seen such a gross looking ""Rockefeller Oyster."" There was no cheese or bacon on it, like what a typical Rockefeller Oyster has. We've tried oysters from several other places in New Orleans and the difference in taste is truly outstanding. So that's $14 down the drain.

For the entree, I ordered a Shrimp Poboy that tasted like frozen shrimp with stale bread. The fries were cold as well. My girlfriend ordered the house burger and I've never seen a burger be butchered so badly. She ordered it medium well with bacon (additional $2). Instead she got a soggy bun with a rare patty and no bacon. The cheese was not melted and there was no lettuce. Which typically come with a cheeseburger.

Right after a very disappointed voodoo tour, my husband and I were so starving. We just hope to have something to fill our stomach. Among all the open restaurants at 10 PM, this place comes with the highest rating so that we chose to dine in here. After we checked the menu, we decide to order some local amd simple dishes: oyster pasta, shrimp jambalaya, and a side salad. And after a half hour waiting time, our food finally got there. Be honest with you, the best dishes among three is the side salad. Start from the shrimp jambalaya. Seriously, o travelled from Chicago to NOLA, and found the jambalaya is much worse than my local restaurant. How ironic that could be. The jambalaya was just so dry, so salty. And the shrimp inside tasted like frozen shrimp. I can even smell the chemicals on the shrimp to keep it fresh. The rice is not juicy, but only salty and dry. If I was not extrem hungry, I don't even want to keep it. Really because I cannot wait for another half hour to get my dish, I just choose to bear it. And the oyster pasta, so watery, so much soup inside. And we could tell that the food might have been ready for a while, but the waitress forgot to bring to us, so the noodle already got sticky together. After all that, the worst part is the price. For those okay food, if you charge me less than $15, I could tell myself to bear them. But when you charge almost $20 and more than $20 on them, but taste like my own home cooking is better than that, I am not feeling right at all.

I'm not sure how it had escaped my attention for so long given the extensive and excellent reviews. 

If compared to Commanders Palace or Antoine's, Royal House is not going to blow you away with innovative New Orleans cuisine. This is a solid, delicious and nice place to experience the cuisine that makes NOLA famous in their most traditional form. There is ONE thing that sets Royal House apart: the charbroiled oysters. I don't like oysters normally, but these are a clear exception. They are fresh (we saw them being brought in to the restaurant by the cart loads), grilled over a charcoal fire, and smothered in melted butter and parmesan cheese goodness. How can one go wrong with butter and parmesan cheese? 

The grilled scallop salad was a nice large tasty healthy choice, and the shrimp po boy consisted of fresh French bread and a generous portion of fried shrimp (though I like the shrimp batter better at Mother's and Oceana). The rawfish ravioli is a very large dish that should be shared by two people in most cases -- warning: It is RICH and sweet. 

We only had one complaint. It was a very chilly day outside, and the host seated us by the door. A brothel has never seen a door open and shut so many times as it did during our hour lunch. The hosts that would stand outside LOVED to go in and out of the door every 30 seconds, and every damn time, they would leave the door standing wide open -- freezing us to death. It was like every host had ADHD. THEN the oyster folks decided to make a delivery during our lunch, which consisted of at least another 10 trips in and out of the front door (is there seriously no back door?). Ugh. Folks, please be sensitive if you're going to seat customers by the door on a cold day. 

Our server was really nice, knowledgeable and engaging. We were seated immediately upon our arrival. The manager came by to make sure that we were having a good experience (which we were except for the swinging saloon door).

Ok, enough about the door. The food here is great, and Royal House has earned a place on our list of options for our annual trip. You should try it too.",2016-01-08 15:21:05

The mushrooms had good flavor but they were cold. For dinner we had crawfish ravioli and the Taste of New Orleans. The ravioli was good but would have been much better if it was stuffed with crawfish instead of in the sauce. The gumbo had good flavor. The jambalaya was bland.

We got seated at 10:45am, we're given breakfast menus and waited for 15 minutes for our server.  At 11, our server came and told us we couldn't order breakfast because it was 11. WTH?  We rolled with it and decided to get drinks.  35 minutes later-still no drinks.  Couldn't find our sever, so we approached a guy we thought was the manager and he said he would take care of it.  Still no drinks, although all other tables had drinks.  Finally got our drinks but we're missing 2.  Staff did nothing so I walked up to the bar and asked the bartender who personally delivered the drinks to our table.  We ordered our food at 11 and didn't get our food till almost noon.  We were missing a couple of meals which they brought out easy enough because we had finally found a manager.  My mom sat at the table and ate her soup with a fork because no one would get a spoon until we finally walked up to the bar and approached the guy who was just talking.  Not one staff member had told the manager we were having issues even though we all got up multiple times and asked about drinks and our food.  Our server rarely came because he didn't want to deal with the questions.  Finally after over 2 hrs of sitting there and eating,  we heard the server asking the manager to get us out if there and that we were problems.  To even be able to over hear that is so unprofessional as we just wanted a quick breakfast and be done!  Were we supposed to sit there for 30 minutes without our bar drinks and just stay quiet?  We had the best service with the clean up of our dishes!  The food was ok-the baked oysters were really salty but their blood Mary's are really good if you get one.  The two people who recommended this place have one multiple times but just as a couple and they've had great experiences but they felt so bad recommending especially for a birthday breakfast.  The manager did take off several meals and was apologetic which was helpful.

Mallory was our waitress and she gave great  recommendations and was super pleasant. We had the crawfish étouffée, fried alligator, hush puppies, and the fish po boy. All were flavorful and really delicious. The fish basically melted in my mouth and was seasoned enough that it wasn't bland as some fried fish is. Alligator was surprisingly great (first time eating it) and I'd definitely get it again. The étouffée was also a first, even though I have nothing to base if on, my taste buds were impressed.

For dessert we had the bread pudding with raisins and white chocolate sauce. Very tasty, but would have been better if it were warmed up in an oven or toaster to be crunchy on outside and soft on inside. It was probably microwaved but still good. I work at a bakery and because it's quicker we do that too, so I'm not going to take stars or credit away for something most business do.

I'm speaking of Royal Street...okay, so not your typical type of royal-ness, but even so, if you want a royally good meal, check out Royal House. I've had two food experiences here (about three years apart) and both were great, though we'll get into why things boiled down to four stars shortly.

For starters (if you didn't already guess), you'll find Royal House on Royal Street at the corner of the namesake road and St. Louis Street. It's perfect in proximity to Omni Royal Orleans where I stayed on both trips to The Big Easy. Walking up you'll notice a somewhat classy European style similar to many establishments in the French Quarter. A nice-sized bar on the first floor with a smaller eating area in the back. At the time of this most recent meal, things were a little crowded so we actually headed upstairs where you'll find a whole other level of seating (and a another bar!). 

Once quickly situated, we were under way. I had talked up char-grilled oysters to my family for years and so we began with a dozen of these babies. Their garlicky, buttery flavor hit the spot and should be tasted even if you're not a fan of this bivalve. With the help of a Yelp check in offer, we also snagged a small appetizer of fried alligator (don't freak out, it's actually delicious). The breading was different from what I remembered, but it still did the trick of being tasty.

Here's where my memory comes into question. I've spent the last three years dreaming of Royal House's shrimp and grits. When I came in 2015, the dish was amazing and easily went down as my favorite meal of the trip. This time? It was different than what I remembered. Less spicy with the shrimp being more barbecued than that last plate. The grits were a bit off as well. Don't get me wrong, it was still totally tasty, but not what I was hoping for. In fact, I might say some shrimp and grits dishes from New York were better (oh my!). But even so, the meal was great (even with a good, but forgettable, waiter).

Overall, Royal House delivered on a quality NOLA-style meal. With a beautiful interior and a tasty selection of choices, I definitely recommend it to those visiting New Orleans. For myself, I now have new images in my head plastered over the old ones. Those originals were five stars. These are more four. Hey, it's like the changing of the crown. Sometimes you absolutely love royalty and sometimes you can't stand it. We'll call this one somewhere decently above an average kingdom on a street made for royalty.",2018-07-05 15:38:27

Despite it not being peak Gulf oyster season, we decided to get a dozen anyway, as we all love oysters and our server (Chris) assured us these were fine. As expected, they weren't the best, but it probably just wasn't the best time for them. Then, we noticed in several of the oysters there was a grainy black gunk that tasted pretty bad.

I raised this to Chris and he was both flippant and condescending, telling me that this is just how oysters are. He even brought over a colleague to repeat the same line to me - ""That's just how oysters are."" I sensed that they weren't really going to try to be any more helpful than this so initially decided to let it go, and thought we could just try to eat around the black gunk.

A few minutes later, Chris came back and again repeated his lecture about the oysters (unsolicited!), this time telling me that if you're not that used to oysters, you might think they're weird, but once you get used to them you just get that this is how they are. (Now, I am by no means an oyster connoisseur, but I am a huge fan of them and eat them every chance I get, and I have never, ever seen one with the bad-tasting black gunk in them like these.) I told Chris that I found it really unusual, and he again repeated his lecture. Perhaps he was just trying to offer some explanation, but I found his tone to be extremely condescending, and his stubborn refusal to acknowledge the possibility of my concern being legitimate was very disrespectful.

At this point I asked to speak to the manager, Lisa, who was actually really nice and offered to change the oysters. We declined, as we needed to leave soon, but we appreciated that she  actually came up with a solution instead of just trying to tell us that there wasn't a problem like Chris and his other colleague did repeatedly.

Other food was fine: gumbo was bland but not offensive, shrimp po' boy was decent and salad was fresh. The hurricane was way too sweet, but the bloody Mary was actually quite nice. However, with so many dining options in New Orleans, I don't think ""fine"" is good enough to stay competitive, and I wouldn't recommend Royal House to anyone.

Unfortunately, the Shrimp Creole was the worst thing I had. Not inedible, just too plain. The waitress warned me that it might be a little spicy, and I was okay with that. But I couldn't taste any spice. The best I could describe what I had is, shrimp cooked in tomato paste served over rice.

I like to think I was pretty successful. We were on the hunt for a place that covered what everyone wanted, and with 9 people, that was tough. We found ourselves standing in front of a restaurant called Royal House Oyster Bar.  After perusing the menu, we all settled on eating there.  I had already tried oysters, shrimp, gumbo,  and jambalaya so I went with the crab legs for lunch. We shared a bunch of fried alligator at the table as well.  Here in Denver, there is a place call Bayou Bob's that has some awesome fried alligator, but this one was so much better.  They were actual pieces, like chicken nuggets. Great flavor and very tender, I would put these at the top of great things I ate in New Orleans. The crab legs came out and the bowl looked very inviting. A couple of crab clusters, corn on the cob rolled in Cajun seasoning, and giant red potatoes.  The one thing missing was the butter.  I had to ask for it to be brought out. They were quick to respond and brought out a very large bowl of drawn butter with tiny pieces of green onion in it.  I don't think this changed the flavoring, just added to the presentation. Overall, most of the party of 9 were happy with their choice.  I think, everyone was on the same page though, and feel that Acme Oyster House was better and less expensive.  Oh and a quick drink recommendation: get the pineapple cucumber mojito",2014-08-10 16:54:32

Not to mention the place is small so the trash cans came through about 6 or 7 times and were really close to the table.
I'm not sure who said that was ok to empty the trash in the middle of a busy day but I was so turned off.

The waiter recommended the shrimp and grits so I tried it. It was horrible the fried grits were interesting but not that good and you would think for $20 that there would be jumbo shrimp but no little baby shrimp that were overcooked and tough. Sent my food back after a few bites and refused to order anything else.

oba8Dag8JPHevyoIGu6LGA,ArkQpVX00DplZ0GzGOlDnA,VQcCL9PiNL_wkGf-uF3fjg,2,0,0,0,"Overall food was okay but not worth the price. Experiment overall was less than I expected. 

So I usually look a place, if it's less that 4 stars I'm probably not going there for dinner. If it's 4 stars I'll give it shot. And if my experience was less than what I would expect I rate it lower and if it's better I rate it higher.

So my wife and I got to this place pretty late probably 9:30. The hostess quoted us for 15 mins so we waited. After about 10 she asked if we would mind sitting at the bar. My wife doesn't really drink so the bar isn't usually our go to for dining but since it was getting late, we went for it. Usually at a bar service is quicker since the bartender is right there and isn't hopping around to tables. The bartender immediately asks for our IDs but wasn't very courteous about it, he said it almost like he didn't think we were of drinking age and he expected that he would turn us away. We both are of age but we look younger so I wasn't surprised he asked just was expecting a little southern charm in the Big Easy and never really got that. On that same note, a guy and his son later sat down at the bar, the rest of their family, 4 women sat behind them, in assuming because they couldn't seat them all together. And the guy gave them the same speil about ""having a valid ID"" which the kid who was probably 13 clearly didn't... then the bartender went on to explain that you have to be over 21 to sit at the bar. I'm not from LA but I'm pretty sure that, that is not the law and I know most states have exceptions for consuming alcohol if you are with a parent/guardian anyway. Doesn't really matter I guess the restaurant can do whatever they want but the bartender later complained to other patrons about how people should have their IDs. 

The bartender was also shucking oysters when the entire time we were there. Typically that's something done in the kitchen or at least at a back work station. Sounds petty, I don't have an aversion to it and it didn't ruin my meal but if your going to charge 20 dollars for shrimp and grits that I could have made in my microwave and 12 for a cocktail, don't shuck your oysters at the bar and then barely wash your hands before you handle everything that you touch. Also my wife ordered a coke when I ordered my cocktail, again we are at the bar, I could have reached over and sprayed the damn thing into a glass myself if there was a glass close enough, but I had to ask the guy a second time to get her what she already ordered, this is after they had to outsource my drink. I pretty sure the guy said at one point, ""we are waiting on the whiskey"", which I was confused about what that meant. Either way he definitely didn't make it, I think the other bartender did, and that way about 10 mins after I ordered it. 

Spinach dip was good but that's pretty simple honestly and hard to mess up. The shrimp and grits weren't bad as far as taste. I live along the gulf coast and I've had my share of shrimp and grits, so I was expecting large sized fresh shrimp but instead it seemed like frozen ones out of a bag tossed in sauce over 3 scoops of grits. And yes I could tell that they were scooped out of a larger dish; they were like 3 little mounds of grits. I don't think they were cheese grits either. Also the bowl that it came in was hotter than the actual meal, so they obviously warmed it up. Again it was edible but certainly not worth 20 dollars. 

I think a lot of places in New Orleans rely on tourism and overprice their items accordingly. This is definitely one of those places.",2019-03-21 04:29:04

While the hubs hates the majority of food from the ocean, I LOVE it. On the hunt for the best po' boy in town, I heard the buzz on Royal house - so off we went!

STAR 1 = Location is killer! Right on the corner of St Louis and Royal St, it's easy to spot, and right in the French Quarter! 

STAR 2 = Staff is outstanding in welcoming guests entering into the restaurant, insanely helpful and 100% attentive! We were seated at a table near the back (with plenty of AC, cause let's face it, it's HOT AF) and our waitress came right over to collect our drink order and assist us in the extensive menu. We started with cocktails which arrived right away! Our sweet server came back numerous times to check on us, tell us history of the building and made us feel right at home.

STAR 3 = Food is delicious! Because I was all about loaded sandwiches, I opted for the fried shrimp po' boy, while the hubs opted for a roast beef po'boy - both of which were piled high with the ""fixin's"" (lettuce, tomato, pickles and more!) and tasted great! We started with the Alligator tail appetizer (cause why not!) and liked that as well! The food came out fast, was large in portion and totally hit the spot! Oysters is what this place is famous for, which I didn't end up sampling but def will next time!

STAR 4 = Make sure to check in on the Yelp app, as you get a free appetizer with the purchase of 2 entrees!

Our waitress, Ashley (?), was very on top of things without even having to be at our table constantly. Seemed she really had the flow of service down. Management also seemed very attentive to ensure that everyone was happy (they should give a lesson or two to certain nearby restaurants). 

We sat on the balcony where we could hear a violinist throughout our meal, fabulously added to ambiance.  I would warn that the patio is at a pretty steep angle that may freak out the more nervous among us. But seemed to hold up fine for us, haha! Also, the wait was  supposedly 25 minutes when we arrived, but we were seated after about 10 minutes. Happy surprise as that's rarely how wait times go. 

We checked in with yelp and ordered the seafood mushrooms for free. They were fantastic. Seriously, so good. Drinks and drink prices were also good. For our entrees, boyfriend got the shrimp poboy and I did the shrimp tortellini. Both we were very satisfied with, although the shrimp didn't seem super high quality  (relatively small and were certainly frozen for some time). But it didn't detract much from the taste too much. Boyfriends poboy was also loooaded with shrimp, which was nice considering lots of places around give you barely a handful.  Could've used more sauce, but that's a very easily remedied personal preference (wait staff was very prompt in grabbing us a touch more).

What really made this trip disappointing is that my experience started to match some of the negative reviews I read. 

First we order the Crab Claws. We initially came here for fried shrimp and other seafood. When the dish came out I was shocked and appalled any manager or restaurant would let such a measly dish leave the kitchen. The taste was good, but there were only 6 claws in the dish with a very small portion of meat, not worth the expensive price it was sold for! 

After we finished, we kept thinking , ""What does this mean for the rest of our dishes."" Our nerves were high. 

Our oysters came out with our shrimp platters, so that was a little frustrating. The oysters weren't great, they weren't as hot and buttery as expected (Acme Oyster House has the best so far) 

Now on to this shrimp platter. Definitely good in terms of breading (it was light enough to taste the shrimp) but I had so many shrimp the size of my nail-beds, which is completely unacceptable for $19!!! You will be pleased with the overall amount of shrimp; Some were a decent size but the others were embryos so I didn't know how to feel and was confused. Needless to say, the shrimp were the highlight of my experience, a plus? 

Nice try Royal House, I won't be returning.

The oysters on half shell were not shucked as well as they could've been, with too many broken shell bits, but the oysters were crisp & clean tasting. Oysters were slurped in record time.

The chargrilled oysters were definitely rich and delicious, but not overly rich like the other oyster selections. I usually skip cooked oysters, but grilled this way was fantastic!

We also shared 2 Crawfish Étouffée entrees which in hindsight we should not have split since we were licking the plates. 

The food runner was a bit harried, and although we mentioned twice that we were sharing the étouffée and asked for extra plates, they never came.

We were a large party of 9 people so getting a reservation anywhere was challenging. We ended up being super late (about 3 hours) but she still had the table waiting for us anyway! We were shocked! She was so happy to see us and gave us all the warmest welcome. Her recommendations were spot on and everything we ate was delicious - the crab claws are to die for!! When it came time to sing happy birthday she went out of her way to get cupcakes because they couldn't do a dessert from the restaurant. This was the sweetest gesture and made me feel so special! Overall, fantastic experience and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for exceptional service and delicious local food.",2017-09-22 20:16:59

We ended up at Royal House based on proximity and didn't really know what to expect,  but I was perfectly content with it. After ordering a hot tea and deciding on the spinach dip as an appetizer for the table (free appetizer with a Yelp check-in!), I perused the menu and had trouble deciding as there were a couple things I really wanted to try. I finally opted for the Roast Beef Po-Boy: Tender debris roasted beef smothered in a brown gravy with a side of French fries.
 
There was entirely too much to eat, even considering the fact that it was 5:00pm and it was my first meal of the day, but it was pretty tasty. The roast beef was cooked well, with no fatty pieces and the gravy had a rich home-style flavor. I do wish that all of the sandwich ingredients had been listed on the menu because I bit into a pickle and that about made me start gagging. I absolutely detest pickles and it is not an item I'd expect on a hot roast beef sandwich. Luckily, there were so many other ingredients and only a few pickle slices, so I was able to pick them off before their nasty juices saturated my bread. The fries were fine but could have done with more seasoning. I used the excess gravy from the Po-Boy to dip them in, but on their own, they were a bit bland.
 
Prices were a little steep in my opinion, but likely on par with the rest of the French Quarter. The restaurant itself was very unique with intricate wood detailing throughout. Although it was a bit small, at least on the side we were sitting, the tables were positioned so that we didn't feel crammed.

She snapped at me and said she was following the recipe but then conceded and added a splash of gin. It was unprofessional of her to roll her eyes and give such a hostile attitude.

No napkins on the table for the drinks and when we asked the waitress for a napkin it look like she pulled out napkins from her apron that of been in there for two weeks and just toss them on the table. As for the food, the oysters were marginal at best. Went to Felix's the night before, and they were way better. The only thing that was really good was the French onion soup.

I arrive and sit at the bar. The bartender strikes up a conversation, asks me where I'm from, etc. Very friendly. He was quick with my drinks and my order. Exceptional service. 

The atmosphere fits right in to the French quarter. It's got an upscale feel while keeping the relaxed Nola attitude. The jazz playing wraps it all together. You could show up in jeans or a jacket and both would feel right at home. 

But what makes this a 5 star joint is the food. The crab claws are the best thing I've had in New Orleans and probably the best seafood dish I've ever had. They sauce is creamy and perfectly salty and the claw meet just falls off. The bread was a little tough, but that's an insignificant complaint,

With the claws I had the oyster duo (half Rockefeller / half Royale). They oysters were perfectly cooked and just melted in your mouth. The baked ingredients did dry out the dish a bit so lemon is necessary. 

Or, you take the sauce from the Crab Claws and put it on top of the oysters. I did and had a momentary glimpse of heaven.

We ducked in during a terrible rainstorm and stayed for a meal. I'm not a big eater so I had the Oyster Tacos, which are really nicely grilled oysters served atop crispy tortilla chips with a generous helping of spicy, crunchy coleslaw. Delicious! I traded one to my husband for tastes of his Taste of New Orleans, a trio of shrimp and chicken gumbo, jambalaya, and crawfish etouffé. The soup was flavorful with chunks of shrimp and chicken, not big pieces, just enough to flavor it. Jambalaya had andouille sausage, which I don't really like, but all the ingredients were balanced and blended so they all contributed to the soup without overpowering it. The crawfish was our favorite, yummy with a brown sauce and chunks of crawfish. Also, he had a side of red beans and rice; I've had it several times in NOLA and this was the best. (I do like my rice and beans so the beans are firm but tender and you can taste them, not mushed together like pea soup.)I tasted his dessert, bananas Foster with scoops of cheesecake on the side. He said it was the best dessert he ever had, and I agree it was exceptional.
Service was very relaxed but we were ok with it partly because of the storm; I liked that I didn't feel rushed although the place was doing a pretty brisk business. You might not like it if you were in a hurry; but I don't think many people here are in a hurry.",2017-06-25 21:45:32

Service: Very poor. Waiter said he was busy serving 5 tables at the same time. Well .. should I care? Not really!

The waiter didn't clear any finished dishes unless we specifically asked, and then he tried to take the platters that were not empty. At the 45 min mark, we asked where the rest of the food was (since a few raw oysters don't take too long to finish). Apparently they had a computer issue.

The French Onion Soup was a little too salty, but if you like that then I'd recommend giving it a try. My parents and I came down from Boston so we're used to getting fresh oysters, but the oysters we had were ok (definitely bigger than New England's) so I'd recommend getting fried ones.

For the main plates ranked in order: Pecan-crusted Mahi Mahi, Blackened Shrimp and Jambalaya, and Blackened Redfish. I really liked the Crystal lemon cream sauce, it went well with the Mahi Mahi and shrimp. The potatoes and green beans that came with the fish were decent.

We also had fried alligator for an appetizer, which was really good. The hush puppies (I really talked them up as I grew up in the south and wanted them all to try it) were a little...I won't say underwhelming, because they were still tasty, but the texture was different from any hush puppy I'd had before, it was a little too dense so they turned back to batter a little bit after some chewing. The food took quite awhile to come out - there didn't seem to be too many people upstairs waiting for food, but I suppose they could've been short staffed because of the holiday (it was 1/1.)

With no reservations and no line we were immediately escorted (upon request) to the upper balcony that overlooks the street. We ordered oysters that were drenched in butter and cheese so those were obviously fabulous (cause you can't screw up something drenched in butter and cheese).

The boy and I knew instantly that we had to order hurricanes...let me tell you, I've had them in Phoenix where there's a super awesome southern restaurant and they're good. But nothing like having a hurricane in NOLA. It tasted like candy, so delicious.

For an appetizer, we had a Yelp check in for a free appetizer and our server recommended redfish beignets. For dinner, we both had to get po'boys. I got oyster and my boyfriend got alligator. The beignets were divine. The sauce they were served with was sweet and very complementary to the flavor of the redfish. Our po'boys were equally good, considering neither of us had tried alligator or oysters.

The ""tacos"" came first - slightly fried oysters with slaw and a dollop of tangy hot sauce on top of a nacho chip. Not sure how this counts as a taco, otherwise good starter. Next was the Taste of New Orleans: a trio of classic NOLA dishes accompanied by three wedges of bread. Jambalaya was very good, especially with some hot sauce; Crawfish Etouffée was a bit overpowering on the salty end, but great with the bread; Seafood Gumbo was forgettable. The side of hush puppies provided the best bang for the buck, as it tasted fresh and came with a delicious dipping sauce.

We sampled all the oysters they had on the menu and they were all delicious. I am used to the ones we get on the West coast, which are very good, but I felt like I have never experienced all these crustaceans have to offer until I made it to the Gulf. So plump, sweet and full of flavor!!

The spinach dip cheese was cold; fries cold; french onion soup luke warm. The BLT had no tomato. I could see one item coming out cold but all of them (especially the oysters?)

My crawfish ravioli was satisfying but I thought it was going to be a little more special. I liked the spinach dip. And the staff was friendly and down to earth. We came here because my husband googled the ""the best shrimp and grits in New Orleans"", originally I was going to give this 3 stars because I hated them. But my husband enjoyed his food and I realized different southern states in the Mississippi delta clearly do and see shrimp and grits differently. I'm not a fan of this restaurant's interpretation. The grits were scooped on to the plate like mashed potatoes instead of being creamy they were thick and chunky. The sauce was more tangy than I'd like and had a sweet aftertaste that I didn't like at all. So decide for yourself, but I'm definitely an Alabama shrimp and grits girl. Or at least the title of ""best shrimp and grits"" needs to be re-evaluated ASAP.",2019-03-23 21:57:13

From other reviews, I take it they are one of the highlights.  Kinda busy, sat at the bar.  Took our order.  Took about 30 minutes for the crab claws to come out...only 8 of them on the plate and they were very small.  The gravy/sauce poured over them was the bomb.  But, between 2 of us they were gone in a couple of minutes.  Came with 2 small pieces of French bread and we sopped up what we could, but there was still gravy on the plate.  We had ordered more bread...they offer ""the garlic bread,"" or ""the free bread.""  We wanted the free which is what ours came with.  Took about another 20 minutes to get 4 small pieces of bread.  BUT, that was enough for us to rid the plate of that scrumptious gravy.  Cost was $13 plus for the claws.  They WERE tasty, the gravy/sauce delicious, but if you go by the pictures they show online and in their advertisements, it's kinda like lookin at a Burger King Whopper advertisement - ain't no comparison to whatcha get.  So, yes they were good.  Will we go back.  Nope.  Service was slight, not much interaction with us after the initial order.  We had to flag down one ""tender"" to get the extra bread.  Yep, they were busy, it was the day before Thanksgiving and I understand, I guess, but I won't go back.  Different strokes for different folks, I guess.

I'll be honest, most of the pics people posted didn't look that great, but, thought we would give it a try. It was a cold evening and they had French Onion soup that sounded delicious.
First- the ladies next to us were not that thrilled. They too were trying to have a nice meal, and it was far from that.  They watched multiple tables get food before them, even though they had not ordered anything special.... and nothing that should have taken the HOuR it took. And they said it was so-so. It definitely looked so-so.  
Now to our food. We got the claw appitizer.  I have only ever had it once- at Copeland's where it was amazing.  They should call and ask Copeland for some help- there's was far from amazing.
Second- we shared a cup of the French onion soup. The cheese was burnt- so lost a lot of the cheesy gooeyness, but, the flavor was amazing. Amazing.
For our entrees- my husband had the tour of New Orleans. At best 1 out of 5 stars.  None of it was well done. None.
I ordered the shrimp creole.  The flavor was not good. Desperately needed seasoning and a kick. Asked for the hotsauce, but quickly realized that my dish was almost completely cold.  Even the bowl they had it in was cool to the touch.  I never send stuff back unless it's truly terrible- but barely warm fish is not very good. They offered to microwave it for me to warm it up- bc microwaved shrimp is good. Um no. So they took it back to remake- but 30 minutes later, my husband is done with his, and mine is still not out. So I told him just to take it off our check.
Neighbors with the 1hr experience had shared their meal to do the bread pudding- and regretted it. Supposedly it was terrible.

If I had read the reviews more, not just the numbers, I would have known that this seems to be more their MO rather than an off night.  Walk a block and go to a local's recommendation - Mr. Ed's- not it was amazing!",2018-12-16 04:57:46

more time passes and as i was using the bathroom dinner was dropped at the table and we were told the kitchen lost the ticket.

We also had the crab claws which the waiter told us to order and I'm so glad we did. It was so good and flavorful. The sauce was amazing. We dipped everything in it.

To make things worse, after chucking said oysters, he then proceeds to grab a glass with his unwashed hands and pours water with the same unwashed hands!!! We then witness this same guy grabbing a to-go cup on the inside of the cup and used one of those hand-held soda streamer with unwashed hands. There was visible oyster debris on his hands and arms while he was making drinks. We promptly walked away from the bar and requested to sit at a table with a different waiter. It just so happened that we were sat near a window facing the outside street where the restaurant keeps their garbage cans. The same bartender/oyster chucker was seen outside throwing away oyster shells and trash in the garbage bins while still ""bartending."" we were absolutely disgusted of this place's lack of food hygiene and SEVERE contamination. This is a serious health concern especially for those with deadly shellfish allergy, avoid at all cost!!!!!

It could use some improvements, as many areas in the French quarter could, but that would take away from its authenticity. 

Food: The reason I keep coming back over the years is their chargrilled oysters. My my my, Delicious. In my opinion, they're the best in the town! The crab fingers are also amazing.

Caprese Tower was fresh with good tasting tomatoes with basaltic vinegar sauce.  Wouldn't change a thing in this meal taste and presentation!  Hurricane was good compared to others in city but the Rum Punch was a hit out of the park!! 

Service:  5 stars-  Sat at bar and taken care of by Leroy and Greg.  They were on spot with recommendations and dished it back (and too each other) as much as I gave it to them.  Leroy made the drinks and were awesome.  He sang allot with the songs playing in background with a carefree attitude and was a natural entertainer.

I happened to be in New Orleans on a really cold night. I arrived and the host told me the wait time for a party of two was 15 minutes.

As soon as I started to complain, I was promptly seated and service thereafter was good.

I didn't get my waitress' name but she was very pleasant and accommodating. The appetizers - fried oysters and fried alligator were delicious if not a hint salty.

After we placed the order, we waited almost an hour before the dishes came out. We had the waiter check in it twice.

We don't know if the waiter missed the finished dishes in the kitchen, or if there were some mistakes in the kitchen.

Apart from that, the dishes tasted badly. We don't think it compares to the other places in New Orleans with similar Yelp ratings. Especially the gumbo, which tasted awful --- the rice tasted like it had been over-burnt and carbonized.

My boyfriend was nice enough to share some of his bread with me to sop up the rest of my sauce, or else I probably would've licked the bowl.  Because it was our last night, we also ordered desert.  I had the pecan pie.  I could've died a happy girl after that!  The service was also fantastic!",2018-10-07 15:36:22

Their sauce was sweet with a touch of kick. 
My entrée was an oyster BLT - the oysters were well breaded and delicious. To me, the pickles and lettuce were a bit much but when in Rome.... hide them on the side and hope the Romans don't have hurt feelings.
Dessert was the highlight of the meal, if not the day. A deconstructed banana cheesecake which was perfect to split and creamy; there was no excessive sweetness.",2016-09-28 04:44:14

I was a little skeptical about the red fish beignet but it was really awesome. There was a sweet sauce that went nicely with the flaky fish and surprisingly the powdered sugar was a nice touch too. The Oysters Rockefeller was good, but I couldn't taste the Sambuca at all.  We shared a French Onion soup which was also quite nice and then had the crab leg boil for our entree.  

Where the drop in the rating comes is from our service. Our waiter was a bit distracted which started with our drinks that he completely forgot. Not a big deal... But when our entree came we only had one.  He actually told us that he ASSUMED that since we were sharing other things, that we were sharing our entree.  The other things were appetizers which are typically shared - entrees are not.  We ended up sharing one entree and completely finishing it before the second entree came out.  When we asked for desert to go - neither one of us was in the mood to be there any longer - the server left in the middle of the order to go help others. When my husband flagged him down to give him to order and get the check, he left again saying he would come back to ""tell us about something spectacular.""  When he finally came back to tell us about some other desert which was different than what we ordered, I was really just done. 

To the credit of the Royal House, I think it was really just our server. He seemed to think he was the star of the show. The other servers appeared to be on it and although the kitchen was a little slow at a very busy time (nothing out of the ordinary), I think our guy detracted from what would have otherwise been a good meal.",2019-08-19 16:16:56

My friend had a taste of their shrimp and grits at a Bloody Mary festival and said they were amazing so that's why we went. Somehow, sadly they were out of shrimp and grits. So I'll never know how good they were. I checked in on here, a free appetizer popped up which I thought was awesome. We got the grab claws. The sauce was really good, but for an appetizer that would be $12 there was no way that was enough crab for that price. We were told they had the best bloody Mary's in New Orleans so we decided to give them a try. Probably one of the worse bloody Mary's I've ever had. There was extremely too much horseradish it in, I could barely drink it. We got the crawfish etouffee and crawfish ravioli to share. The portions, especially the etouffee, were extremely small for the price. The etouffee was really good, so was the ravioli but it was of cold. Cold ravioli is never too good. We got the bananas foster for dessert and it was DELICIOUS. Best thing we has there. I'd go back just to get the bananas foster. When it was time to pay our bill we found out they give locals a discount. Which is pretty awesome. BUT you can't combine the local discount and our Yelp free appetizer together. They just gave us our locals discount which ended up being more than the appetizer so that was pretty nice. Would have been nice to know that before hand.

Like other Yelpers, we go tricked with the high Yelp reviews . . .

Drinks are decent, most of the food is not.

The mahi mahi tasted more like frozen than fresh, and was cooked to the point where it was pretty much inedible. Oysters were shucked poorly, shards of shell were embedded in every one!

We got the spinach dip as a Yelp check in offer, and had to continually ask for it and it didn't arrive until after they had cleared our entree dishes. And we begrudgingly ate the mediocre dip simply because we didn't want to waste food.

Utter garbage. I have never seen, felt, or tasted such dry, overcooked shrimp. I didn't even know it was possible. I think it was likely boiled and then sat under the heat lamps for a good 10 to 20 minutes. I wish I would have taken a picture of the dish in all its dry, rubbery glory because someone else needs to witness it. The corn that came with it was inedible (think biting into the brown corn stalks you see people decorating with at Thanksgiving) and the potatoes were so salty, like a cured ham. 

When the server asked how the food was I told her it was overcooked and not good. She didn't say anything and then seemed to be avoiding eye contact the rest of the time we were there. She cleared everyone's plates except for my very full one even though I placed my silverware and napkin on the table, clearly done. I could have (and honestly should have) made a bigger stink to save myself the wasted money but I was so done and didn't feel like expending the energy. Finally, after she gave us the checks back, I was able to ask her to please take the plate and reiterated how dry and overcooked and cold it was. She said, ""I got you."" and took the plate away. No apology or anything. I mean I know it's uncomfortable when someone tells you the food is bad but come on!

Meanwhile, if you aren't a tourist and have had true Cajun food, what comes out of the kitchen might disappoint you, as it did us. Keep in mind I can only comment on what we ate, which wasn't good. It was below average, unfortunately. Considering the inflated cost we almost sent it back, but after waiting more than 40 minutes for our food, we figured it was in our best interest to scarf it down (regrettably) and continue on to Pat Obrien's. 

I've eaten Cajun food religiously across the South for almost two decades now and through experience have learned good and not-so-good. For example, I ordered blackened redfish at Pappadeaux in Dallas on Wednesday night, then blackened redfish here at the Royal House Thursday and then the same dish at Louisiana Lagniappe Restaurant in Baton Rouge on Friday night. The first and third were juicy, well seasoned and flavorful. At Royal House the redfish was severely overcooked, mildly fishy (unacceptable), the thickest part of the fillet was dry and the entire third of the outside portion was tough as leather. 

As for the ribeye, we ordered it rare. All but the inside third of the meat had no pink to it. None. Again, more than overcooked. Maybe leather like fish and meat is the in-thing here? As for the vegetables, we had just left Chef Ron's Gumbo Stop in Metarie for lunch where our side of veggies were seasoned, fresh and crisp, which embarrassed Royal's canned tasting, soft veggies. The entire meal was a waste of money, time and took away from one of our two true NOLA Cajun meals. We were only here one night. 

Unfortunately, we didn't choose to eat here, but their sister restaurant (which did look good in photos) closed two hours early because they wanted to paint. They sent us to Royal and said the food was exactly the same. In addition, service was poor. More than 40 minutes to get our food and a waitress with an attitude. We won't be back. Meanwhile, if you are coming for oysters and drinks you'll probably love this place, but entrees are a different story.",2018-10-21 18:30:47

Crab Claws ($13.50): even if you don't like crab legs, you MUST get this dish for that cajun sauce alone. Like, I would buy a bottle of that sauce to go if I could bring it back on the plane. Delicious, buttery, garlicky, creamy sauce that went so well with the bread slices made for dipping. Crab claws were super tiny and didn't soak much of the flavor, but damn, again, you're just here for the sauce. 

Chargrilled Oysters ($20 for dozen): whoaaaaaa! Cheesy, piping hot, salty and filled with herb goodness, you can't miss out on these either! The oysters itself were pretty tiny considering the size of the shells (some were almost palm sized!) but the ""stuff"" more than made up for it!

Taste of New Orleans ($18): this came with jambalaya, shrimp etouffee,  and gumbo. Least impressed with this, but glad that we got to knock down all three things in one plate!

Okay. I decided to take a few days before writing this review. We were in Nola for three days after the LSU game. The place was nearly across the street from our hotel and always seemed to have a line during the dinner hours. It had a 4 star yelp rating so we decided to give it a go.  
We walked over and were told by the greeter there was only a 10 min wait despite the long line outside. We decided to forgo another reservation and wait. 
Well, ten minutes turned into forty. We were finally seated and when the waitress arrived, she let us know that she was having to be a server and runner. (Interestingly there was a 40 minute wait but there were three to four other open tables when we got to the upstairs dining room.) 
We ordered appetizers and waited, and waited some more. Apps arrived. Crab claws had good flavor but were tiny. Spinach dip was decent but only a handful of chips were supplied.  Dinner order was placed and we inquired about getting more chips.  Waitress said there would be a $2 charge which we said that was fine and ordered them.
After asking another server, and ours again, the chips were still not delivered. Our waitress brought them as we were nearing the end of our dinner. Then she seemed surprised we didn't want them anymore. 
About the time our entrees came is when we saw the first of FOUR COCKROACHES during our time at the restaurant. The first one was very large and crawling across the middle of the wall. I understand these buildings are old, but it was gross. At least three servers saw and kept on walking.  
The food itself was fair.  
We ordered: The Taste of New Orleans.  Bland, flavorless -essentially all dishes tasted the same,  the spinach salad - which was fine, the fried shrimp - quite small and dry which seemed either overcooked or not fresh, and the crawfish ravioli. That was probably the best item we tried.
We never got a water refill or a check back to see how everything was.  
In the men's room is where I saw two more cockroaches. One on the wall and another on the floor just cruising around. That was enough for me to want to get out of this place. On the way out we had one more cockroach sighting on the stairs. 
Food was mediocre at best. Service was poor. The place was gross and I will never go back.",2019-10-17 04:04:43

YxJRFyjz_GS_01f8_xTs4Q,yPtw4a_lVeCCWLC9qK8Haw,VQcCL9PiNL_wkGf-uF3fjg,2,1,0,0,"This place really disappointed, but in my recent return to NOLA, I am shocked at the caliber of foodstuffs found within this hallowed foodie locale. I've always know to avoid the french quarter if value and flavor is what you're in search of - shame on me, I suppose. We tried a sampler platter of étouffée, gumbo, and Jambalaya. Not impressed with any dish they brought out. 

The gumbo tasted more homogenous and sweet than muddy and interesting, and was much more refined than you normally would expect in a gumbo - as though they strained out all the wonderful bits that developed through time. I was told that a full cup of each soup comes with the platter of three items, but I would summate that if I had the ability to combine all three dishes, I would find little more than a cup of soup between all three. The rest of what I purchased assuredly was rice, so ask for rice on the side if you order a cup to be sure of your quantities - save for the jambalaya. 

The jambalaya was mildly flavorful, and the sausage was fine - but not what you would expect in NOLA. Hell, I get better Andouille in Kansas City at a place called Fritz's Smoked Meats, on State-line Road. 

The étouffée was the most interesting, but still tasted like something other than seafood. I couldn't place it, but it's not what I expected - I could not eat it after a few tastings. They also seem to use some sort of thickener that has nothing to do with time and love; the soups were bordering on gelatinous. 

I would never return to this place, as the value gained from the purchase price is far too unbalanced; the death knell for me however must have been the flavors; they aren't revolting, but just not at all what you'd expect. More refined and subtle than the strong, dirty creole seasonings you search out for in NOLA. This experience serves me right, as in my travels I've come to take mark of establishments with ""sandwich wranglers"" hustling just outside the door, obnoxiously inviting patrons to dine within. If I were you, I would find a less debutant experience if what you seek is a more visceral cajun cuisine. You'll find none of that here.",2017-11-22 18:44:54

The food and service weren't bad but it was definitely lacking any sort of wow factor. We started with the charbroiled oysters, which were underwhelming. The garlic butter was good but they weren't cooked long enough. For dinner I had the Taste of New Orleans which was a sampler of the Jambalaya, Étouffée, and the Gumbo.

My friend had the chargrilled oysters. I myself am not a seafood fan but I tried one. They weren't fishy at all and the flavor of the bread crumbs, garlic and butter was really good. My friend did say they were on the small side but delicious. 

I had the French onion soup, which our waitress claimed was 'the best in the entire city', as well as some hush puppies. The soup was absolutely wonderful. It was rich and not too salty, as the can often be. The cheese and bread baked on top broke up nicely as I ate it so I was left with a giant bread and cheese ball. The hush puppies were average. 

The second visit was on a Tuesday afternoon. We couldn't sit on the balcony because those tables only seat two and this trip there were three of us. 
However we were able to sit next to the open doors of the balcony and still enjoy the lovely weather and view. 

We had a couple cocktails that were both good. I ordered the roast beef po-boy. It was average. Not very flavorful compared to most of the food I'd been eating the entire trip. My friend had the shrimp po-boy and was also disappointed. She was expecting some sauce or more flavor as well to what she was eating. My other friend had the french onion soup and of course loved it. We finished with bread pudding that was actually very tasty and rich. 

The walk up stairs is narrow and definitely feels like and old home or building. Complete with the unevenness that makes some a bit nervous. But the decor makes it worth the climb.

The atmosphere is super cozy and intimate, set in a lovely historic building. The tables are on the smaller side so drinks and food pile up quickly, though the staff is swift to retrieve the empties. The service was outstanding! Ask for Tina if you go there, she's a hoot! The owner was very warm and welcoming with the Southern hospitality. 

Now let me tell you about the crab claw appetizer. It came with 4 pieces of garlic toast cut on the bias and many small meaty claws. And the creamy, spicy tomato sauce it was drenched in... OMG! It's the stuff that I will forever day dream about! It's pure heaven! So devine! 

The food did take about 25 mins to arrive but they were slammed. We downed many hurricane drinks while we waited, which were nicely made. I ordered the gulf shrimp and grits. It had a creamy Creole BBQ sauce and the grits were a little bit clumpy with Gouda cheese. Very tasty though. 

My friend got the ribeye dinner. Done to perfection. I may have to go back one more time while I'm here for the crab claw magic though! Highly recommend this restaurant!",2019-02-11 03:53:50

Not to sound like a fatty, but I was scrapping the cheese off the shell with my knife (okay, I lied... my nails!  I didn't want to sound like a super fatty).  My tour guide loves oysters and has tried many charbroiled oysters around NOLA and says Royal House is definitely the best.  

Furthermore, since it was my first NOLA meal, my tour guide suggested I get the Taste of New Orleans, which allows you to sample the city's dishes: chicken and sausage jambalaya, crawfish etouffee, and chicken and sausage gumbo.  My personal favorite of the three was the etouffee, but that was my first time having it, so I don't have anything to compare it to.

AND I don't remember what the drink was called, but I had this mango drink from the bar that our server recommended.  SOOOO GOOD!

However, I didn't feel up to taking the trek to Parkway Bakery for one. I wasn't impressed at all with the food and service at this place. Our server hyped up how their French onion soup was the best in the French Quarter as well as their po boys. My sister and I were excited, ordered a bowl, and was highly let down. It came piping hot, looked good but, was very salty and didn't have a lot of flavor other than salt. I'm glad my server took it off the bill after he saw that I barely touched it. We checked in and earned a free appetizer which, we chose their spinach dip. It was okay but, I have no idea why the chef sprinkled parmesan cheese on top of the chips rather than bake it on top of the dip itself. We thought that was so odd. They give you way too many chips for the amount of dip they give you but, whatever, it was free. All of the food arrived separately,  with an excessive wait time in between. One particular waiter was walking around talking, joking with other employees, cursing outloud, and dropping the ""F"" bomb while we ate. We just looked at each other. We had no clue what his problem was. Now, for these amazing roast beef po boys...NOPE! I ordered my sandwich ""undressed"" and pickles on the side and they came with fries. I believe my sister's was dressed. However, both of ours was mostly all gravy bread. We looked at each other shocked. These things barely had any meat inside with some stray onion pieces in it. Their bread was fresh and good, though. Their gravy tasted like Franco American beef gravy from the can. I was so disappointed in this place. I could've made a better one at home. As I was leaving, I just looked annoyed at our talkative waiter. That entire meal should've been given away for free. Next time, I'll follow my first mind and go to Parkway Bakery, like before.

There seems to always be a wait to get in, but as long as its not too long a wait, like 15 or 20 min, I'd wait for it.  On my most recent visit, I popped in by myself and sat at the bar and ordered up my favorite cocktail from here- called the Grey Goose Drunken Shirley.  It's basically an alcoholic version of a Shirley Temple- (just add vodka!) and I got an order of the appetizer Oyster tacos.  I was a bit disappointed that they were so small. I was expecting fried oysters in mini soft taco shells but it was more like 4 nacho chips (thick pita type chips) topped with fried oysters and pico-de-gallo type toppings and sauce.  Good, but not what I expected and not filling enough.    

Since I was still hungry, I ordered a half dozen of the oyster duo - which is 3 oysters Rockefeller and 3 prepared another way, which I'm drawing a blank on at the moment.  Service was quick and the guys behind the oyster bar could not be friendlier.

My aunt ordered some trio sampler which was all very good (minus the gumbo), and I had half oysters Rockefeller and half chargrilled. I have never had such large, fresh, flavorful, juicy oysters before. It was nearly orgasmic! I was extremely satisfied with my meal. Since I had the alcohol munchies I wanted to order another half dozen of the oysters Rockefeller and a side of étouffée (since my aunts was unlike anything I've ever tasted). We waited....and waited...and nearly fell asleep..and waited..and needed refills.. when she finally came around we asked for the check and I asked for my order to-go so I could David Hasselhoff it in my hotel room.

The first floor bar smells like a old, moist towel without laundry for three months. Part of it came from the oyster, and the guy open the shells does not ware gloves. He also chatted with customers and shake their hand before going back to open more shells. No oysters was on ice before or after the the process. Ice only met oysters 30 second before your table. Lisa A Elfer is the one who signed their health certificate. He also rubs his face with the same hands. Health Alert!!! I am sitting on the high chair for ten minute, and finally get a MENU,covered with unknown liquid. 

The bar is lovely if you can hold your breath. I was not brave enough to order oyster that night after I saw the opened oysters were sitting on the counter without ice.. You are surely braver than I am. I finally ordered fried gator meat, and taste of New Orleans. unlike other places, they could not do the gator meat blacked. I guess seasoning requires more skills and good spies.  I was so glad that I brought my own water since they did not offer any. 17 minutes in water is in front of me now!!!

The alligator is half the portion compared to what I had this week in other places. It is about $1.50 per bites. You need eat with your hands. Interestingly, the lemon slice amen with it  was covered with shredded cheese. The gator meat is very soft, and soooooo salty. Someone tipped over the salt jar?  Unfortunately, I told the staff that I will have my beer when the dishes arrive. And I never saw my beer that night. 

Taste of New Orleans has three cup of, crawfish étouffée, chicken gumbo, and creole. The crawfish étouffée is well cooked, with plenty of hot spicy taste. The chicken is very good too. It contains chunks of smoked sausage, and enriched with smoky flavor. Chicken meat soaked with the flavor from Cajun, black pepper in the soup is one of the high light.

The food was good but not great. I had higher hopes and am hoping they were just so busy the kitchen staff was over worked. My shrimp and grits were lukewarm and the salad had waaaayyy too much dressing.

Shrimp Creole- There must be a shortage in fisherman after these Gulf Shrimp. 4 Shrimp on my wifes plate 4. The Sauce tasted too much like marinara sauce. Not pleasant taste.

I walked by this place the next 2 days and there seemed to be no wait at all during dinner time.

Chargrilled Oysters (4/5): delicious, get it. My only complaint is that there were 2 overcooked oysters in my half dozen. They were over-baked so the oyster meat basically disappeared and it was all black. So, I only got 4 oysters in that half-dozen. Not great.

Crab Claws (5/5): this was probably my favorite. Loved the sauce and the bread for dipping!

Fried Alligator (3/5): Do yourself a favor and order this at another restaurant. It was such a small bowl AND there was a piece of bread underneath so the portion was SO SMALL. For this price, you can get double the portion at other places.

Seafood Pasta (3/5): Tastes like canned tomato sauce and dining hall pasta. Don't get this.

Voodoo Cocktail (1/5): SO SWEET and tasted so artificial. Don't order this.

Brandy Milk (3/5): too watered down. So much ice in this.

The crab claws were good- perhaps the best item they had. The shrimp and grits was BLAND-maybe they forgot that they forgot to add seasoning? We actually couldn't finish it, and the portion was dinky. The shrimp creole, however, was pretty good.

We're in town from the west coast for my 40th birthday, mind you. We all order and our dishes came out. I ordered the red beans and andouille sausage and my friend had the shrimp creole. Both our dishes had rice and the rice was hard and crunchy. We sent our dishes back to the kitchen because we weren't satisfied. Our dishes came back out and my friend's dish was good this time, mine wasn't. I got the attention of the waitress and let her know, I decided I wasn't going to try for a 3rd try. I was going to order a different dish and they weren't even trying to take care of my meal for the inconvenience. The waitress then came back and said that they would take care of half of my replacement dish. That was not acceptable to me. We asked for the manager ""Ms. Shirley"" and her first words when she got to her table we're ""ok, what's the issue"". Her approach was totally off and there was no sympathy what so ever. Like it was my fault the kitchen can't make rice in a creole restaurant. We let her know that her tact and technique came across very wrong and she didn't agree and walked away. I then decided to just cancel my replacement dish, I didn't feel comfortable eating there after all of this. As a consumer/customer you shouldn't feel as though you are the problem or feel safe eating somewhere because you spoke up about poor quality.

I'm updating my post from last nights issues. The manger Michael responding to a friend's email about our experience from the night before and wanted to invite back to apologize in person and also give them an opportunity to make things right. We decided to give them a chance. We arrived and shown to a table. Michael came out and introduced himself and apologize for the actions and behavior of his staff. The went above and beyond and we all appreciated their effort. They took care of everything we ordered and the service by Tina was excellent.

Everyone's friendly and service was great. My friend and I sat in the balcony seats overlooking the street. If you do sit up there, it's not flat, so things can slide off the table, so you can't have glass there because it would be terrible to fall on a person below. Pretty cool place. 

I ordered the Taste of New Orleans, which was a sampling of Chicken & Andouille Jambalaya, Crawfish Etouffée and Chicken and Andouille Gumbo. The bowls seemed small, but they are just the right amount of food and it really was a good sampling. My friend had red beans and rice (I had the Andouille sausage since she's meatless). Be sure to check-in on Yelp for a free appetizer. We tried the Eggplant Chips since it was the other non-meat item and I liked it. I do like eggplant and it's cheesy with Alfredo and marinara sauce. Otherwise, there are other stuff I wanted to try. I didn't get to try the oysters, so maybe next time. 

We had some drinks, too. I had the Voodoo Cocktail, which was pretty sweet, and something else...I can't quite remember. Be careful with drinks when you're sitting on the balcony.

yUZw4EdLHKSxReg2AkvXJA,uvDbpqntHt9HpMQJo2rsig,VQcCL9PiNL_wkGf-uF3fjg,1,0,0,0,"My friend and I decided came here to try a po-boy because of favorable Yelp reviews and great (read: professional) photos. We were duped. On arrival, I asked about the Yelp checkin for a free appetizer and was told it was valid, and that we could get a free app. We ordered two apps (French onion soup and fried alligator) and a po-boy to share between us. 

The French onion soup was ok, nothing memorable or worth writing home about. It was a little salty but had a nice layer of melted cheese on top. The fried alligator had potential, with decent seasoning and breading. It was, however, very oily and the cuts of meat were not great (I'm assuming all gator meat is not like that, dark and grisly). The po-boy, the reason we stopped by this venue, was terrible. The bread (more like cardboard) was insanely dry. The sandwich comes ""dressed,"" according to the menu, which meant it had lettuce, tomatoes and pickles. Apparently this also meant that there was not a drop of sauce or mayo or any moisture inside, which rendered it unfathomably dry. If you could bite into the Sahara desert, I imagine it would taste like this.

And when it came time to get our checks, the manager walked over to our table and made us pull out the yelp coupon. He made us zoom in and pointed out the fine print that read ""valid with purchase of 2 entrees."" Mind you, this text was not visible from the main Yelp page (it just says valid with purchase, the fine print is shown after you click claim offer) and that the waiter had told us our order was fine and we could use the promotion. He told us they wouldn't honor the deal. 

If the food had been stellar I would have let the deceptive marketing tactics slide, but somehow you managed to deliver a double whammy of terrible customer experience and charged me $40 for it. But hell hath no fury like capitalism and a free market with public reviews. I definitely will not be returning and would recommend you avoid this spot too. If you're looking for a po-boy, don't make the same mistake I did and go for the more legit spots (just Google them).

Just as a side note, our server, who said she didn't know about the 2 entree policy, was cordial and apologetic. We had no qualms with her.",2019-09-09 19:26:45

This is such a beautiful and busy city yet charming and exclusive. There were so many restaurants to choose from but I was told that they were all good. I parked my car closest to Royal House so I decided to eat here. Big shout out to our waitress Raven! She was super welcoming, I enjoyed her conversations as much as I did the food.

The restaurant itself is very packed. We chose to sit at the one of the open window so we can enjoy the city walk while dining. We ordered grilled oysters, Rockefeller oysters and oysters royals, shrimp creole, crab claws in garlic butter and gumbo. 

This was my first time having oysters in New Orleans. There is nothing better than eating a food at its origins. It's like eating a cheesesteak in the heart of Philly. The oysters royals had breading on top that makes it filling and hearty, the grilled oysters was fused with garlic butter and charred flavor, and the Rockefeller savory with creamy spinach. Individually, they were good, together? They were phenomenal! The shrimp creole was also distinctive, it tasted had a stronger acidic note than what I am used to but nevertheless, delicious. The real kicker here was the crab claws. It is not the claws themselves that makes this unique, it's the sauce! Oh man, the creamy, garlic butter sauce that the claws were cooked in is heavenly. You can put this in pasta, clams, on top of lobsters, oysters, roasted bread, pizza, rice, you name it, it will make everything a thousand times better! 

Overall, it was such an amazing experience. I'm used to Philly where it's busy and people rush you out of restaurants. Here however, we took our time and our waitress loved us for it, it's like she didn't want us to leave and just hang out.

I had this dish earlier this year in another part of the country served with plenty of rice and I think that's how it should be served. Otherwise you are just eating sauce and shrimp. 

The shrimp and grits were good. Kind of mashed up grits into two balls and the sauce was very good. I liked the creaminess here. I don't like some places that make a soupy shrimp and grits. There seems to be so many different ways of making this dish. Portion sizes seem to be slightly on the smaller side here. Not cheap, but the shrimp is good.

As we are getting seated by the host, they offered us a seat outside of the restaurant. Sounds cool. Great ambiance, music in the streets. 10 minutes passed, no waiter. 20 minutes later, still no waiter so we decided to walk into the bar to find some service. Decided to sit at the bar and was greeted by Jessica M.

So, Jessica M. She must've had a really long day of work at the bar. She was rude, mean and made us feel as if requesting for extra ketchup or hot sauce was a burden. She slams the kitchen door next to us after receiving our request and gives a big sigh.  After dinner  was done, I mentioned the yelp review and she was so upset. She slammed the door once again, in an effort to look for the manager. Once the bill was ran, she again slammed the check, upset because she was unable to find a pen.

Now, the food. We ordered crab claws. They came out cold and was plated with 5 claws. For 13.50 and 5 small crab claws? Ridiculous. Crawfish ravioli. Again, cold.  Barely any sauce and ravioli hard and dry. Shrimp po boy was okay. Charbroiled oysters can't go wrong.

My friend got gumbo which she liked. I got the rib eye. The first attempt was really not good...I'm a patient person, maybe too much so. This was t he first time in my life I've sent food back. But what was great is our waiter (John or at least that's what the receipt said) knew. He gave me my food and specifically said, I will return after you cut to see what you think. Cause he knew it wasn't what I asked for. So he took it back and I swear a totally different person had to have made it. Lol it came back perfect and was delicious. Plenty of buttery-ness if you're into that. You don't get a lot of crab meat if you add that FYI. 

The five stars is honestly mostly for our waiter. He is wild and will chat you up. He comp'd the steak and ended up bringing me the pecan pie (very good and different from your typical) for my birthday dessert, also free. He also got this random table of me to sing me happy birthday.

My friend ordered a French 75 and wanted something added to it - the bartender had to problem running downstairs to get him what he wanted. He was hospitable and happy to get us whatever we wanted.

I ordered the Oyster Duo - Sample both of the oyster favorites: Oysters Rockefeller and Oysters Royale. Oyster Rockefeller are Louisiana oysters with sauteed spinach, bacon, sambuca, and baked to a golden brown. Oyster Royale are Louisiana oysters topped with their seafood stuffing and baked to bubbly perfection.

My friends ordered the Taste of New Orleans Entree. It was a sampling of the city's most famous dishes: Chicken & Andouille Jambalaya, Crawfish Etouffee and Chicken and Andouille Gumbo. They loved it! I also ordered a side of Red Beans and Rice - because why not? They did not disappoint!

The service was great -- every employee I saw was engaging with guests like they were hosting them in their own homes. It was excellent hospitality -- and I've found the bar to be set quite high in New Orleans.

The service I would give 1 star as I had never had this happen to us before. To begin with, we sat under a table that the AC or something was leaking on. It wasn't horrible, but a couple of times during the dinner we felt the drops. It wasn't a huge deal, so we didn't even mention it.

Here is the bad part. For appetizers we ordered oyster on the half shell, Rockefeller's oysters and crab claws. Well, they brought us the oysters on the half shell and then completely forgot our other appetizers! Who does that! Our waitress didn't even notice until we pointed it out to her.

From the moment we walked in we felt welcomed and comfortable!  The hostess was friendly, down to earth with a great sense of humor and professional customer service skills!

We came for breakfast and sat on the balcony upstairs. At first we felt a little tipsy and a bit awkward but after settling in for a minute or two we didn't notice the slant at all! We had just arrived in New Orleans the night before and celebrated a bit too much so we weren't too adventurous in the culinary department! I had the Southerner and hubby had the Eggs Benedict, both pretty simple selections and both were outstanding!! Probably some of the absolute best gravy I've ever had with a very light biscuit and eggs cooked perfectly. Hubby didn't need extra Hollandaise or lemon which is probably a first! We shared a side of bacon and it was nice a crispy just like we both like it! 

Our service was spot on as well!  Very efficient and friendly yet super classy and professional. She kept waters full, delivered the food piping hot and had a smile every time we saw her.

The only reason I'm giving a 4 star review and not a 5 star is because they don't have any ""sweet"" offering on the breakfast menu. We usually like something such as a sweet roll or french toast to balance everything out so we were just a tiny bit disappointed when we found out they had nothing to offer.

The Royal House gave us the royal treatment for breakfast and we'll definitely be back next time!",2016-05-04 21:52:57

The crawfish ravioli was also really good. It was loaded with a bunch of crawfish and crab and I really enjoyed it. I don't eat crawfish that often because peeling it yourself is really tiring, but when the crawfish is peeled for you and it's paired with wonderful ravioli, it's a great experience.

The Gumbo bowl and fried alligator  missing in the pics as they are small in quantity and they are gone before we clicked pictures. 

Louisiana is famous for its seafood and we ordered all seafood dishes. 

Tried alligator(crocodile) meat for the first time and this dish tasted like chicken popcorn which has more harder meat with same taste as chicken popcorn. 

Gumbo cup is one of the famous dish in New Orleans as I have seen lot of places with boards saying they serve Gumbo bowls. It tasted more like a sambar rice with different spices. First impression was like this isn't tastes good but after few spoons of that Gumbo rice, it's addictive until you finish the bowl

Crawfish Etoufee - This sauce tasted like sambar too but tasted Like a better version of Gumbo bowl with some fried crawfish meat in it.

Seafood Pescator - seafood pasta with scampi sauce. We substituted marinara sauce with Scampi sauce. This is the best dish at this place. Sauce tasted more like a garlic and butter base sauce. Sauce is so addictive and we were cleaning the plate with side breads for sauce.

Shrimp Jambalaya- tastes good with more shrimp in the plate. But other 2 entrees dominated this dish with their sauces. 

Shrimp Po-boy - typical subway kind of sub with some fried shrimp and veggies. Tastes ok but the bread is so good that we dipped the bread in the Scampi sauce to enjoy that sauce. 

We got a yelp checkin deal to wave off an appetizer and we used it to for fried Alligator. And the rest costed us $92 with taxes.",2019-07-06 16:15:22

Upon walking in around 6ish on a weeknight, I immediately was drawn to the bar area where shucking was being done live. If you are not fond of the typical sea water smell, I'd suggest getting a seat at a table as the bar can get quite stinky. Either way, seating was quick and painless and I was presented a menu right away. I of course wanted some darn oysters due to the fact that guy was shucking them in front of me and splashing me with that tasty salt water (Is that gross?). Ended up chatting with a local next to me and we shared a large platter of oysters raw and boy oh boy were they good! After downing some raw goodness, I realized that I had yet to sample any jambalaya or etouffee', which was sad as I had been in New Orleans for a few days already. The Royal House delivered though offering a sample platter with Chicken & Andouille Jambalaya, Crawfish Etouffée and Chicken and Andouille Gumbo. Order took awhile to arrive, but not the end of the world. The sampler was good, but honestly not the best as some of the dishes were lukewarm and lacking some flavor. Pricing was on the high side, but hey it's the middle of the French Quarter, its like complaining while eating in the middle of Paris, expect it and move on.

Service: was decent. At times, it took a while to get a drink (they came out at different times)

Food: We started off with the artichoke dip. It was cold so we had to return it. The couple next to us had to return their gumbo because it was also cold. The second one they brought out was piping hot. All the meals were on point with the exception of the Shrimp and Grits. There was something off with the flavor. There was a spice that I couldn't place that was too fragrant in my mouth, as if I was eating lavender. It over powered the entire dish. The other two pasta dishes I would order again.

Honestly, the food was not great. You're better off going to a cheaper place to eat.

I ordered half a dozen oysters on a Tuesday night at 6 pm, and didn't receive them until 45 minutes later. The waiter explained that they had two large parties upstairs, which is understandable. What's less understandable was receiving my oysters with incredibly muddy shells - we're talking dollops of sandy mud dropping off the edges. After 3-4, I flagged down one of the waitstaff to politely inquire about it, she stated ""this is just how oysters always come"" and asked, ""are you eating them correctly?""

I think she meant well and wanted me to have a good experience, but I don't think I've ever been asked that question that way before (customer service background kicking in: a good alternative way to get the same information would have been to ask, ""May I see how you're eating them?"")

Because yelp gives you a free appetizer with the purchase of 2 entrées (they were flexible about what is considered an ""appetizer""!), we started with the Oyster Duo.

We got three dishes in total: the cooked oyster duo was the HIT! Duo is comprised of the ""Rockerfeller style"" (cheeeeese) and ""Royal House style"" (the best!)

The seafood gumbo was just ok.
The shrimp platter was awful, both shrimps and fries were way too much fried, and the coleslaw was disgusting overfilled with sauce.

So, my recommendation at the end of the day would be get the Oyster and enjoy your Margarita on the second floor balcony. Then that would be what I call ""perfection"". :)",2013-02-01 02:20:47

In my opinion the crab claws were probably the only decent thing we had. Neither of the 6 of us cared for the mushrooms. We also got chargrilled oysters that were small and not worth $20 at all.

My friend probably took 2 bites of her pasta and pushed it aside. The seafood platter was room temperature and just overall mediocre. My friend hated the soup trio and said it tasted nothing like jambalaya, etoufee, or red beans. The boiling pots lacked so much flavor that we expected since we are in New Orleans.. AND they were supposed to come with corn, which we never got. And when I asked my server if it was supposed to come with it she said yes but we probably ran out since it's the end of the night. It would have been nice to have been offered a substitution or be told they were out to begin with. They probably hoped we wouldn't notice. And the rib eye was just ok.

Sure, you pay for the ambiance or the overall hype but Royal House was a disappointment for such a pricey lunch.

The food was nothing spectacular and as someone who rarely uses the salt shaker, it was pretty much next to my plate the entire time.  I ordered the pasta with seafood, and the husband ordered the seafood combo.  We also ordered a dozen of oysters and their crab claws off the appetizer list.  The oysters had an unusual smell and taste.  My husband and I love oysters and we usually toss a coin to see who gets the last one -- this time, we actually insisted to pass.  My pasta was tasteless and appeared to be a whole blob of spaghetti noodles thrown in with under seasoned seafood bites.  My mussels were empty shells and the rest of it needed salt or any form of seasoning.  The husband was not particularly impressed with his dish neither.

Here is the big kicker:  our entrees took a full hour to get to our table.  I was so upset, I nearly walked out but as I was getting ready to leave -- the food miraculously came out of the kitchen.  I could've left but choose not to because I knew that if I did at that point, the restaurant would have tossed out the food.  I hate food waste, so we stayed and grunted as we stuffed down the food we no longer wanted.

I'm giving an extra star to the rating because our crab claws were really good.  The sauce was of what we thought a good creole dish should taste like.  I'm giving one more extra star for the outside patio seating.  On a nice day, you get to sit above the restaurant and watch all the festivities that take place on Royal Street.  Very lively.

Aside from those two highlights, try at your own risk.",2018-12-01 06:12:52

They did their best with the few people they had. :/ holiday weekend. Anyway mixed likes. I mean it was all good. But varying good. I really enjoyed the boiled shrimp. Very simple not as spicy as I was hoping. Potato was kind of bland too. But we had the tomato caprese salad starter and it was delicious. Could have used a little extra balsamic and flat layered instead of towered would make for easier sharing. Not the season for tomato
Either but the mozzarella was perfect.  Hubby had the shrimp and grits. And although different with mozzarella but delicious. Said it was absolutely delish. 
Also had blackened redfish. It was good but again wanted so much more kick. For the prices I think we faired out pretty good. Serving four people and appetizer free with my check using Yelp! Now that was awesome!!!

Anyway I enjoyed the atmosphere and the waitstaff. :) recommend if you get there early and order without having to wait. Nice variety on the regular menu is why I give it a 4 star!! :)",2016-05-30 03:45:22

I tried to remedy with adding things, but it was a lost cause.

9rSUYjP9rIPOr4T53TpxCw,ABlSOquUAEYSUvySN0AeXw,VQcCL9PiNL_wkGf-uF3fjg,5,3,0,2,"On our morning stop to start our whirlwind of tasting through New Orleans, we hit Royal House.  Compared to my first nights disaster elsewhere, we were treated to our first real chargrilled oysters that seemed to be something special. I left this review sit for 6 days to compare all the other places I had oysters at and I must say this is my #1 pick for the chargrilled oyster.

Compared to other places who use shredded Parmesan, I found these to be the best with FINELY GRATED Parmesan on top of a garlic butter bathed oyster. You could see the oyster clearly with that nice mound of finely grated and melted Parmesan on top. It wasn't buried under a thick blanket of cheese where all you tasted was cheese.

All the flavors together worked well including the clean taste of the oyster and most importantly no grit in your oyster. Nothing ruins a great oyster experience more than taking in that oyster and then CRUNCH...CRACK, and you are left starring at the person across from you wondering ""should I spit it out, try to take it out gracefully between my fingers and leave the good part, or just pick up my napkin for the full KAPOOEY in the napkin experience.""

Thankfully, it was all oyster goodness.  
On top of having great oysters they infuse their own vodka and make their own Bloody Mary mix. I had one with my oysters being it was 11 O'Mary in New Orleans. I was really impressed at how good it tasted along with the various garnishes. Clearly making your own mix fresh and using vodka from your own infuser makes a huge difference (as it should).

My vote for the best chargrilled oysters out of half a  dozen other places tasted during my visit. I am sure there are others out there in this town of oysters but this is a sure bet on the list.

Conveniently on Royal Street you can't miss the signs on the corner of Royal and St. Louis.

szBJSEdjpQMfJzqvMro_nw,5PYov1g61DMrAu1rqLwQWA,VQcCL9PiNL_wkGf-uF3fjg,1,0,0,0,"Like with other recent reviewers, we were drawn in by this restaurant's good rating. Group of 9 stopped in for a late lunch. Almost everything that could have gone poorly did. 

First, the place wasn't particularly busy, maybe half full on a late Saturday afternoon. We ordered alcoholic drinks and then our appetizers a bit after and everything seemed normal. It took almost an hour for the appetizers to arrive. Drinks hadn't even arrived yet. We would end up getting them 15 mins after the appetizers came out. Apparently the bar had ""run out of everything"". Everything. 

It took even longer for the entrees to came out, with several additional problems. We got two orders of the ravioli but each one looked drastically different. They didn't even seem like the same order. They entirely forgot one order (which we never endsd ip getting but remained on the bill) and potentially two more on top of that. We waited on the gumbo and the crawfish etoufeé and asked someone if those were coming. 

The waiter (not our primary waitress) responded they'll get right on it, implying they hadn't been done? Their rush was apparent because the crawfish had lots of shell bits and the rice was splattered all over the plate haphazardly. There were only 3 pieces of unfried crawfish. The gumbo looked like it was hastily poured from an appetizer bowl into an entree bowl, and was very small portion-wise with very little meat. We had to send the gumbo back. 

Another cherry on top was a waitress (not ours) spilled a tray of waters on one of our people. Another waitress who was handing out silverware napkin bundles had a terrible attitude. For me, she just slapped in onto my shoulder and waited for me to grab it there with my other hand. Lastly, we didn't get a single refill on our water until the end of our 2 hour mess of a meal. 

Meal came out to almost $400. At this price point, the service, speed, and food quality/consistency was SORELY lacking.

Overall, reminded me of the worst tourist trap restaurants you'd see in Santa Monica, CA. Our experience was very different from those in Royal's good reviews; it felt like we were in an entirely different place.

As with most places in the quarter, Royal House is clearly over-hyped and under delivers.  We ordered drinks which were watered down and overpriced.  I asked from a double Blanton's (a single barrel Kentucky Bourbon) to which the server replied that she'd never heard of that particular beer and then promptly handed me their beer list.  

We ordered their signature raw oysters as an appetizer. They were obviously days old and not the ""fresh on the day"" that they portray and were a gelatinous mess which had not been properly shucked, rinsed and plated.  

I ordered their All You Can Eat endless shrimp bowl which arrived finger blistering hot and looking and tasting like they had been boiled for three days in ""fracking"" mud.  The All You Can Eat turned into a barely able to touch.  The corn on the cob side was over cooked and mushy.  I did not think that you could over cook corn on the cob so badly and still have it stay on the cob.

I do have to say that my wife ordered their rib eye which she enjoyed as it was properly dressed and properly cooked to medium rare.  My daughter ordered their Oyster Pasta which she also enjoyed.

And no, I did not complain because I did not want to hurt my daughter's feelings as she selected the venue especially for my birthday.

To wrap up:
1. Service - Extremely average, servers need to be educated on their bar stock and the difference between a top shelf Kentucky Bourbon and bottle beer.  Ours could have been a bit more attentive...it was not busy...several tables were open on a Tuesday night.
2. Raw Oysters - C'Mon man!  Horrible and disappointing for a signature offering.
3. All You Can Eat Shrimp -  See #2, above!

Given the choice go to Acme for Oysters and there have to be better places to get shrimp, too.",2015-10-21 16:12:06

The raw oysters were meaty, but very light on the flavor and liquor (or whatever you think of as the juice in the raw oyster). I eat a lot of oysters, and these ones were on the mild side. At the same time, I have had far worse oysters-these just were't amazing. While New Orleans is known for oysters, I usually have better oysters in D.C.

The blackened shrimp and jambalaya were also mediocre. Mushy jambalaya and the shrimp should have had a charred texture to them, but rather were just little sauteed shrimp with basic spices on them- Not really what I think of as blackened shrimp.

John even ended up giving a ton of great recommendations for my very first visit to NOLA.

The food itself was a 4-Star good but I think the staff truly made our visit a shining 5. My companion and I got the crawfish etouffe and the blackened redfish and finished our dinner off with the butter pecan pie. Yum! I'll not a NOLA food expert but it all tasted great.

Staff - I don't​ know what the deal was, but the staff was not enthusuastic, or seemingly happy to be there.  The hostesses and food servers were not rude, but just like they were doing us a favor​ by serving us.  That being said, our waiter was either new​ or sleepwalking.  We asked for a lemon with our water, but it took a very long time to bring a slice and several reminders to the waiter​.  OK a small thing - but a symptom.  The food order was screwed up and it took forever to bring out the correct dish which was a roast beef po-boy.  Why it took so long to re-fire a sandwhich I have no idea, but is anything worse than a member of your party sitting and waiting for food as everyone else eats?

Failure to refill an ice tea or see if I wanted another beer are things you are taught in waiter 101.  He was professional and polite, just not an​ efficient waiter.  The food was presented by separate​ kitchen servers who just kind of popped it down on the​ table in an indifferent​​t manner that didn't fit the perceived quality of the restaurant​. 

As for the food quality - it was very good.  We all really enjoyed our meals.  Food alone would be 4 star.  Red beans rice and sausage, crawfish etouffee, and beef po-boy.

The place was busy and the ​seating was tight, but the overall groove was nice and comforable.  There are a whole lot of eating choices in the French Quarter, and the Royal will have to do better to maintain its rating.",2019-04-13 19:14:43

The place was empty except for a few tables and were seated by a very quiet waiter. My friend said ""Hi!"" and the waiter replied ""Not yet...later though!""   So after we finished laughing about that, we ordered a Mojito, a Big Boy Root Beer Float and some alcoholic, coconut drink.  The mojito was surprisingly sub-par for how simple it is.  It was not stirred at all and the proportion of rum to soda was disgusting.  The root beer float was an interesting concept with rum, amaretto, root beer and ice cream.  This was good, but I felt that if I finished it all I would have been a hot mess on Bourbon Street.  Thank god for sharing.  The coconut drink was refreshing, but nothing special.

Crawfish Starter
Shrimp tortellini 
Tour of New Orleans 
Crawfish Ravioli 

Now I was afraid to order anything because I don't do spicy so I ordered the tortellini. What a mistake. The Crawfish ravioli had a sauce that was savory and I kept dipping my tortellini in it. The Crawfish starter had an amazing sauce. I have no idea what kind of sauce but it was so good we didn't have any left. 

I ordered voodoo juice which was dangerous because you can't taste the liquor. It was refreshing.

Appetizer:
1. crab fingers- way to saucy. And all of the claws didn't have meat on it. On the salty side.
2. French onion soup- salty but tasty and piping hot. The way soup should be with a nice crusted cheese topping.
Lunch:
1. Char grilled lobster- nice cheesy and garlicky, but once again to salty. And one of them had a raw taste to it.
2. Royal house salad- this was my healthy snack and it was good. Lots of spinach, cranberry candied walnuts and cheese. Nice and light topped with perfectly cooked pan seared scallops.
3. Sweet and salty crab legs- seasoned with Old Bay. Also had a side of corn and potatos. This was good.

For lunch, my dining partner and I ordered the following:
Oysters Duo (3 Rockefeller oysters + 3 Royal oysters) - The oysters were nicely baked to a golden color and were tasty. The Royal oyster's seafood stuffing was particularly delightful. 

Taste of New Orleans (cup of chicken and andouille gumbo + cup of crawfish étouffée + cup of jambalaya) - This entree contains lots of rice, so watch out if you are on a low-carb diet. Crawfish étouffée was creamy and full of flavor, and was the best out of the 3. Jambalaya was tasty and the rice was cooked just right. The gumbo was a bit thick and didn't have much flavor. 

Shrimp Po Boy - The shrimp was nice and crispy, and the bread was fresh and soft. Fries came with the po boy and they were crispy and good.

Royal House served us quickly and filled our bellies. Our server, Joseph, was attentive without being overbearing. 

I personally recommend the corn and crab chowder and the Bananas Foster cheesecake. Their portions are generous and probably big enough to share if you aren't as ravenous as we were. The desserts are definitely big enough for 3 people to have conservative bites of. Everything was very fresh and the other diners I was with raved about their oysters.

The crab claws are sauteed in a lemon garlic sauce with toasted bread on the side and let me tell you this dish was packed with so much flavor! The crab claws were alright, but the sauce was amazing! I don't know what they put in it, but I would order 3 of these if I knew how good it actually was. Truly an amazing dish! 

For my entree I order the seafood pescatore which is described on the menu as coming in a marinara sauce which seemed strange to me, but I really wanted a pasta dish so I ordered it nonetheless. I do not eat shrimp so the server told me I could substitute with extra of another meat instead. I ended up getting extra scallops. When my dish came out the smell was just heavenly and adding the extra scallops was probably the best decision I made! The scallops were huge and they were seared off perfectly! Here's the kicker though... The dish did not come in a marinara sauce it was in what looked like a white sauce with what I can only assume was grated Parmesan on top.

We were in a desperate hunt for food on a Saturday night and decided to try out Royal House since it was convenient and open.  I asked the waitress if she could split my po-boy with half shrimp and half fish, and she said they wouldn't allow it.  Instead, the waitress talked me into ordering Crawfish Etouffee, which I was already apprehensive about because restaurants can never really get this dish down right.  Crawfish Etouffee is one of my favorite Creole meals and I am highly critical of it, but to be fair, Royal House's etouffee was horrible.  Most of the crawfish were charcoal colored and they were extremely salty.  One of the bites of food that I took was so salty that I had to dispose of it.  I wouldn't recommend ordering this dish from here to anyone.

My bf ordered the Alligator Bites, and they were lukewarm, hard, and had an old taste to them.  It was evident that this alligator was not fried at the time we were there.  I assume it was probably fried earlier that morning.

I would never come here again.  The food wasn't good and definitely wasn't worth the price.

Which was not too bad, because we were serenaded by a beautiful violinist during our meal. 

Even though it was very busy our server brought us our drinks and immediately took our order when we were ready. For appetizers we ordered one order of half shelled oysters as well as chargrilled oysters. For my entree I ordered the mahi mahi and my boyfriend ordered the shrimp po boy. 

When we recieved the oysters they also gave us a VERY generous amount of crackers to go with our oysters. This was my first time tryinf chargrilled oysters so I was a bit worried I would not like them very much. But I was wrong! The chargrilled oysters were filled with so much flavor that I had never encountered before. Although I still prefer the regular half shelled oysters, the chargrilled oysters were a nice change from my usual taste of choice. 

For my entree the mahi mahi is where the 3 star review comes into play. The presentation of mt entree was fine but the taste of the fish was.. absolutely.. nothing. I am not usually picky about taste at all but when there is no taste? That is when it is different. The potatoes and shrimp that came with my dish were fine, it was only the fish that fell very disappointing. My boyfriend on the other hand realt enjoyed his po boy, although the size of the dish was quite small.

Appetizer
We ordered the Fried Alligator it was my Bosses first time having it and it was super good. Papadeaux makes a better Fried Alligator it's less chewy but all in all it was good.

Cocktails
I had a Hurricane which was way too sweet, 
Zatarains at the New Orleans Airport is way stronger and will set you right!

My boss had a manhattan which was super good and strong!

Entrees
I had my waitress decide for us:

Boss
Roast beef Po Boy-Very Dry, cold and needed more jus.

I had the Pecan Crusted Fish-Cooked perfectly, very moist but the sauce on top lacked flavor and could have used more.

Corn Maque Choux-slap your mom delicious. Creamy and exploding with flavor.

This was like crack for us and we kept ordering more (hence the reason why we came back another night).  Oysters Royal were really good as well, however better on the first night than the second. The crawfish cakes appetizer was very tasty (got it on the Yelp check in deal...so glad I got to try them...thanks Yelp!).  I had the shrimp and grits (which was on my must have NOLA food list) and it was fabulous with a slightly spicy sauce and creamy grits with gouda cheese (they sold me on that one).  Lastly we shared the bananas foster cheesecake...so divine...LOVED IT and I am not a big dessert purchaser.

Do be warned to make reservations as there could be a big wait.  We were lucky and seated within minutes of arriving, however we were right next to the hostess station and heard people getting turned away. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive and handled our crazy group well (4 of us, but with a couple of drinks in us we were a little goofy at times). ;P

If in town again I will definitely be coming here to have more of the chargrilled oysters and maybe trying another one of their specialties. I can't believe I didn't try redfish when I was in NOLA so next time!",2014-04-17 04:12:03

I stopped in this week to grab a late dinner.  I was in town for business so I grabbed a seat at the bar and started chatting it up with the guy working there.

I'm guessing he was 20 years old, and knew the menu well.  Made a few recommendations and we continued to talk.

I ordered the ""trio"" sampler that consisted of oysters done a few different ways.  One of the best dishes I've had in NOLA.  I've been to all the fancy places in NOLA and the food was in line with some of the places that will charge you 4 times more.

We Took a seat on the balcony for the true New Orleans experience . We were greeted by our host and seated immediately. We started with half a dozen raw and half a dozen Char oysters.
The raw oysters were okay but the char oysters stole the show . After finished we're tempted to get another round . 
For drinks we my wife had red wine and I had a hurricane .
The drinks were given in plastic cups , which we attributed to the fact of being outside as the smaller tables may not have been able to properly hold glasses .

The drinks were good . For entree we had the crawfish ravioli and the BLT oyster Po Boy. The crawfish had flavor but it didn't seem to meet the hype that we faced in other reviews.
The BLT Po boy for me was not the best .
The bread was a little dry and I didn't not feel that the flavors meshed as much as I anticipated.

Overall , I would definitely revisit Royal House  1 because of the experience and ambiance of New Orleans is there despite the entrees not being as pleasurable as we had liked but If I were come back I'd order as many char grilled oysters as I possibly could eat because they are that good and that alone moved this from a 3 to a 4 star review !!!!",2019-08-24 22:33:13

Although some other reviewers placed this as a tourist trap, I'm actually more than happy to admit I would come here again.

Location and setup : It was a little bit of a walk but about 0.1 mi from our hotel. This is a hilarious distance for me but for my parents aged 5x, hungry, and after a long day of exploring the Mississippi River they were a little against walking far. Mom, why did you try to wear heeled sandals? I know it's a trend but they're not going to make you anywhere close to 5' 1"". Anyhow I digress, it's close to the river and close to Canal. Which is great plus it's quiet enough away from bourbon street to talk to your party.

Food : We had --

Crawfish Etouffee ($14.95) the waiter recommended adding fried crawfish ontop. So we had DOUBLE the amount of crawfish. It was so good, I actually thought it would be like shepherd's pie but the rice soaked the moisture of the sauce. It's good, but if you're not into stew-y food or wet foods you should pick something else. Best way to describe it for me was Arroz con Pollo cept Crawfish instead of chicken.

Alligator Poboy ($12.95) alligator meat is sour and salty. Be prepared but my dad actually enjoyed it alot. Then again he loves salt. It tastes like grilled then fried lemon tilapia to me. Tilapia because it's white meat and still has that slight fish taste. It was good plus their seasons (double fried???) french fries were good.

Shrimp Poboy ($10.95) Classic is still a goodie. They do it right and affordable. Generous amount of friends and a very fresh bread to tag along. Good stuff!

Chargrilled Oysters ($15 for dozen) oh my god, I don't eat oysters but I had to try these. SO GOOD SO SOO GOOD. You must you must! I wish I had a drink to pair with it but since I'm out with the parents we're not allowed to drink. Buzzkill.

Banana Foster Cheesecake ($6.95) very pretty and presented well. It was delicious and now I'm hooked on Banana Foster ANYTHING. Thank god I packed skirts and dresses instead of skinny jeans.

Love the food, ambiance, live music, spacious seating and great location, but the most important to me regarding an outing with the folks was the service. My waiter was from Los Angeles and moved here and he's a very sharp guy. Speaks a bit of Korean, Japanese (from his time working in Beni Hana), French, and Spanish. He was very nice, quick, polite, and he actually came to our table without food to have a chat with us. My parents forgot about the aches in their feet and the walk or the loud crowds from Bourbon we had to pass, and just cared about the good food, music, and the light conversation.

In all, including our lemonades and a single beer plus tip the meal costs us about $90. Not bad at all for a party of 4.",2012-04-03 03:48:58

The chargrilled oysters..can't say those were really chargrilled. Threw some cheese and sprinkled some seasoning. Some pieces didn't even have melted cheese. 

Shrimp and grits were the worst shrimp and grits I've ever  tasted. They were cold and dry. When I think grits, I think warm, creamy, and taking a hearty spoonful followed by a juicy shrimp. These grits were cold and the consistency was like mashed potatoes. They actually gave scoops of it on the plate. Have you every thought of grits as a scoop?? Like an ice cream scoop, like a mashed potato scoop. And it's a Cold scoop. Not my kind of grits. They were nothing close to the photos on their website. Not close by any means.

We started with half a dozen chargrilled and raw oysters. The chargrilled oysters were pure buttery, cheesy flavor and the raw oysters were the largest I've ever seen and very fresh. However, the outer shells were not well-scrubbed and left debris on my fingers and inside one of the shells. Considering the horseradish and cocktail sauce are pretty standard, it might be worth a skip. (Regardless, I still enjoyed - overall the oysters were good but not excellent).

The crab claws were a tasty starter but naturally not super filling. The grilled oysters on the other hand were much richer with the bubbly tasty cheese baked right in. 

The Crawfish Ravioli was cheesy, and spiced wonderfully. It has crawfish tails and lumps of crabs woven throughout. 

The rice and beans are solid and everything you'd expect. The sausages were a little over cooked when we got it and it came with two strips of fried chicken which I wasn't expecting. Solid choice.

The other food - gumbo and jambalaya - were ok, but not memorable, especially given stiff restaurant competition in the area.

The host took us in addition to another party and sat us at the same time which felt very impersonal. After that, our server quickly took our drink order, then forgot one of our drinks. Finally about 15 minutes later our server returned to ask us for our order. Keep in mind, we were the first table sat upstairs, so why did we have to wait so long to put our order in? I asked about the market price of the seafood and then ordered the Alaskan snow crab but when our food came out they brought me a shrimp platter. When I told the food runner it was wrong he said ""oh this server never makes mistakes"" To which I said ""well I ordered the Alaskan crab...this is shrimp"" To which he then took it back and I didn't receive my order until Over half an hour later when the rest of my party had finished their food. When the wrong order had been brought out the server said he would ask the manager to do something for me. We never saw the manager until after our check came. When our server hadn't revisited our table almost thirty minutes after the crab came out, I asked for our check. The check included everything INCLUDING the shrimp platter that was never ordered AND the crab and I never saw a manager. So I asked to speak to the manager as I was originally told. The manager came out and I told him my complaint about the poor service with the crab and the time it took and how inconvenient it was that my party had already finished their food by the time I even got mine. He said ""I'm so sorry, let me see what I can do for you."" He went to the back and then came back out and was doing his normal business throughout the restaurant and didn't come back to our table. Then our server came and grabbed our check and ran it, and then when he came back I asked to speak to the manager again. The manager came back and said ""what can I do for you?"" To which I was astounded and just said ""uhh...you said you were going to see what you could do about the service situation..."" he said ""sorry, let me see your check"" and then voided the check and recharged it without the crab or shrimp platter on there. Then he left the table and the server never came back to our table. We left and I doubt we will ever come back to this place.

That's the one and only thing that is worth getting here, I came here on a sunny afternoon and was able to sit outside on the balcony, the restaurant is only about 3 years old, but the interior makes it feel as if it was built in the 60s. I love it. 

The chairs and tables have an old - fashioned 1960s feel, and made me feel as if I were transported back to the 60s.  This restaurant is definitely a tourist trap and so overpriced.  I ordered the cajun sampler and 6 chargrilled oysters, the Cajun sampler had gumbo, crawfish etouffe, and jambalaya $18 ( not worth it), the jambalaya was plain and not tasty at all.  The gumbo just tasted like water, and the etouffe wasn't warm or savory at all. 

I probably would only have given them 2 stars but the chargrilled oysters were freaking delicious.  Next time I will probably just order a dozen chargrilled oysters and nothing else.

I am only going to say this once, this is pound for pound the best Oyster bar in the city, which means it is one of the best Oyster bars in the country! 

For me my bread and butter is the Crab claws...dude...no lie, I honestly feel like they sprinkle crack in it or something, it is the very definition of delicious and HANDS down the best version of crab claws in the city of New Orleans and I stand by that statement! Oh and here is a pro move, order it with extra crab meat...thank me later!

Next is the Redfish Beignet, this is one of the most simple yet unique dishes I have ever tasted and for me it's the signature dish of the resteraunt, it is sweet savory with just a wisp of spice, but what makes it delicious is that it is really light with the texture of a tempura, honestly it is a perfect marriage of all the beautiful flavors of New Orleans, whoever created this dish needs a t-shirt with their picture on it AND a second line in their honor no cap!

Lastly I am gonna show love to the oyster shuckers, if you come to this place I highly encourage you to sit at the Oyster Bar and if you are REALLY lucky Nirobi or Anthony will be working and without question they are the heart and SOUL of the Royal house and are perfect ambassadors of everything southern and New Orleans, they are fun informative and talented, watching them work is special because they make something that is truly difficult look easy while fully engaging you in colorful and fun dialogue.",2019-02-05 06:32:36

The staff was from sister restaurants in areas less affected.  Also some seafood items were not available because of contamination from the storm.

With all that said what a dining experience!

The alligator bites were a hit with my group and were something special. The caprese and eggplant appetizers were delicious.

The drinks were spot on as well. You can see the vodka infusion for the bloody Mary's at the bar along with the local draft beer.

Everyone enjoy their food. The ribeye was so tender it came with a butter knife. The po boy oyster was lightly fried and the breading was seasoned well. My head bobbed up and down and this is perfectly how it should taste.

The New Orleans sampler was a highlight. A good portion of 4 different things. One of favorite taste came from this dish.

Even the burger is perfectly cooked and seasoned.  Get up and get down to the French Quarter and get a true taste of New Orleans hospitality and cooking at the highest level.

When my girlfriend and I asked the host at Royal House if we could sit at one of the tables on the second floor balcony, he didn't consult a seating chart. He just walked out onto the street and looked up at the balcony, and then said that they did have an opening. 

If you go to Royal House, you have to eat on the second floor balcony if it is available. The balcony itself tilts slightly downward, and our table happened to be tilted at a more dramatic angle. We ended up having to lean our glasses against the rail so they wouldn't slide. It certainly made lunch more exciting. The view from the balcony was awesome, and the music was even better. A street band was performing on Royal Street, and it was like we had VIP seats to the performance. The previous day, we had gone to a ""jazz brunch"" at Mr B's Bistro where we only ended up hearing a few songs. This was way better! We got to listen to a full performance and see all of the people dancing on the street to the music. 

Royal House has a check-in deal on Yelp, so that if you check in, you get a free appetizer (up to $10) with the purchase of two entrees. We ordered the spinach dip with chips for our appetizer. For our main course, we had the crispy fried fish platter and the Taste of New Orleans platter which included gumbo, crawfish etouffee, and jambalaya. 

The spinach dip was really tasty, and did I mention it was free? The Taste of New Orleans platter had just the right amount of each dish. The star of the dish was the etouffee. It was rich, hearty, and had some good spice to it. The gumbo was really flavorful, and the jambalaya was just okay. The crispy fried fish was light and crispy, and the fish tasted really fresh. The flavor was really elevated by adding some Louisiana hot sauce to the fish. 

Our service was excellent. I already talked about the awesome host, and our server was just as good. She was friendly and had a great sense of humor.

The excitement ended when I bit into my sandwich.  While the roll was really good and the shredded lettuce was crisp, the oysters themselves were extremely disappointing. They were so tasteless -- none of that satisfying salty taste of the sea -- that I actually checked to see if they were indeed oysters.  Additionally, a number of the oysters were incredibly tough.  When I bit into them, it felt like my teeth were tearing through tendons which definitely wasn't appetizing.  I ended up not eating about a third of the oysters.  

I'm a huge fan of hush puppies so I also ordered their jalapeno hush puppies.  So disappointing.  They were basically tasteless and the only heat was from the accompanying hot sauce.  I really don't think there were any jalapenos in the hush puppies themselves.

On the positive side, the iced tea was good.

Moving on from that, the food was terrible. I ordered the BLT Oyster po-boy which is supposed to come with bacon, lettuce, and wait for it tomato (BLT). It got to the table without tomato and the French bread was stale and inedible. So I basically had fried oysters for dinner-it saved me the carbs I guess, but if I had just wanted fried oysters, I would have ordered fried oysters.

She not only knows her product line but offered us suggestions that made our visit exceptional. The food was phenomenal and I would highly recommend anyone to go and enjoy an experience and atmosphere and not just an amazing meal. All the staff was very pleasant and supportive but Gaynell ran the show for our table. I fully enjoyed everything and look forward to my next visit to try a new dish. 

To the Royal house management, Gaynell is an valuable employee and I strongly suggest you take care of this gem for the benefit of your business. And lastly to Gaynell, I cannot thank you enough for your pleasant smile and hospitality. You were awesome girl.",2019-12-06 23:16:44

I HIGHLY recommend that everyone asks for him. He represents everything New Orleans is about. GREAT HOSPITALITY, GREAT CONVERSATIONS, GREAT FOOD RECOMMENDATIONS! He is very knowledgeable of the menu. He got me to try things I didn't think to order. We were told that we Had to order a Hurricane. It did not disappoint. Decided to order appetizers and settled for the (Alligator). To my surprise it was pretty good. He offered the suggestion to use the Chipotle Pepper Sauce and it was FIRE!!!!!! Absolutely AMAZING!

After the appetizers he suggested the shrimp and catfish platter. Another TOP NOTCH suggestion. My wife ordered the taste of New Orleans. She enjoyed that as well.

No big deal since there is always something to see out in the streets of the French Quarter.  The architecture and history all around is a sight to see!  When we were finally seated, we were greeted by our very awesome waiter.  Our service from start to finish was top notch as well.  

We checked in on Yelp, so were were able to redeem a free appetizer. I wanted to stick with some good ole Cajun food, so Fried Alligator it was!  It was seasoned and cooked to perfection.  It had a slight heat like I would expect out of this dish.  For my entree, I decided on the crawfish etouffee.  It was tasty and filling, but I have had better.  Now the table favorite which my daughter ordered was the pecan crusted mahi mahi.  It was pan seared, but with the pecan crust, it had a nice deep fried crust to it.  The lemon butter sauce topped on the fish was outstanding.  It really made the dish.  She ordered garlic mashed potatoes and hush puppies on the side which were both tasty.  My wife's redfish was delicious as well.  It was blackened just right and the taste was great.  For dessert, if there is bread pudding on the menu, I'm getting it, full or not!  What made this bread pudding stand apart from others is that there was peaches baked into it.  It was a nice touch and a pleasant change from just raisins.  The sauce on top was a frangelico sauce which is essentially a hazelnut topping.  Delicious I tell ya!

When we walked up, the line was out the door so we were a little worried about the wait. It turned out that the wait was only 15 minutes and I think it ended up being even less than that. They turn tables around really quickly in here and it seems like they have a very efficient seating system set up with walkie talkies and things like that. I was happy about that. 

I ordered the crawfish cakes as an appetizer and my friend ordered the chargrilled oysters. The cc's were ok. The flavor was a little off. You get 2 crawfish cakes per order. We actually used the Yelp check in offer to pay for that so I had no complaints. The chargrilled oysters from what I heard were OK. They definitely were not as good as the ones at Katies! 

We finished our apps and we literally waited about 25 minutes before our meals came out. We were starving and the waitress never came back and acknowledged that the food was taking a long time. That was a minus on her end. The waitress gave us her recommendations for food and I went with her first choice, the shrimp tortellini. I was not impressed at all by the crunchy bread crumbs sprinkled all over the dish. The texture of the pasta was a little weird and mushy. The sauce wasn't very tasty. Overall it was ok.

SERVICE: Super charming waitress serving us that wonderful southern hospitality. She called us ""baby"" and ""honey"" and gave us just the right amount of southern sass. Loved her.

FOOD: I got the shrimp creole. The shrimp and sauce were delicious but the rice was bland and slightly undercooked. My sister had the ribeye which was tasty and grilled to perfection. The side of vegetables were very bland though. My other sister had the bowl of gumbo - which was very lack luster, tbh. Every dish had a great portion and an ""eh"" portion. Not sure which outweighed the other.

Highlight of the night was the fried alligator. Can't believe I even typed that. It was our first time trying it. The picture looked so delicious - it got us feeling adventurous. I know people say ""it tastes like chicken"", but this seriously did! It was juicy, tender, and packed with flavor. The lemon squeeze and cocktail sauce really drove this home.

That's actually a bit unfair.  There are plenty of food options around French Quarter, and I didn't have a chance to try that many of them.  The main reason for this is to get anywhere in French Quarter you have to walk through streets that smell like someone peed vomit out their asshole.

But I digress, Royal House is an astounding place.  We came here with a party of 7 at peak dinner hours and barely had to wait at all for a table, so not sure if we got lucky or what with that.

Service right out of the gate was great.  friendly staff up front, super friendly waitress who we could chat a bit with but not enough to the point where it gets weird.  You know how it goes.

Food:

-Fried alligator: Used the check-in offer to get this for free.  It was good...tasted like popcorn chicken really.  I don't know if that's a disappointment or a relief, it is what it is really.

-Shrimp tortellini: I really enjoyed it.  My wife thought it was a bit too creamy, which boils down to a matter of preference I suppose.  But definitely full of flavor.

-Taste of New Orleans: The crawfish etouffee was really, really good.  I wasn't big on the gumbo or jambalaya, but I would definitely go for the etouffee again.

Really, just a good, solid restaurant with great food and a good atmosphere.  I see a few people being a bit on this place for being for tourists...

..dude, you're in French Quarter, of course it's for tourists.  It's a touristy section of New Orleans.  If I wanted true, authentic creole food right from the source I'd need to go knocking on doors, and I'm not 100% sure southern hospitality extends quite that far.",2016-07-12 03:44:21

The restaurant had a Mardi Gras menu, but of course did not post it online, so we chose this restaurant based on the regular menu.  When we sat down and they handed me this menu with only a couple choices, I was quite disappointed that they had removed the only dishes I was going to want.  I ended up ordering the French Onion Soup and a Caprese Salad because they were literally the only things on the Mardi Gras menu that I'd eat (I hate seafood...we chose this restaurant because it had Oysters and didn't have the insane line that Acme has). The soup was okay, though I did like that it had a lot of cheese, it definitely did not have a flavor that stood out as anything but a TGI Friday's quality soup.  The Caprese Salad was not only far too small, but it had onions on it.  What?  Onions on Caprese?  That is weird.  Plus, the restaurant didn't serve bread with the meal, nor with my soup or my Salad.  I requested bread and they charged me $2.50.  

Also, the wine selection is pretty bad.  It's basically only bottles that you can get at Trader Joe's for $10 or less.  Not a single decent wine on the list.  

A funny thing happened though.  The women I was with think that the place is haunted.  One of them said she felt someone grab her arm (she screamed out of nowhere) and two of the other women said they saw something moving at that moment.  They asked the Waitress is weird things happen there and she had all kinds of stories.  So maybe if you're into the occult this place is a good option.  Also, the Crawfish Etouffee and Oysters got good reviews from the ladies in my party, but I'm basing my review on my own meal.

Definitely a better option than Acme Oyster House for tourists during peak times like Jazz Fest or Mardi Gras.  No need to wait in the line at Acme when Royal House has Oysters in a better location without the line.",2012-02-22 20:03:02

Well. 
Sadly, I was disappointed. 
We ordered a spinach salad and a dozen oysters, locally caught I believe. 
The oysters were massive; some of the largest I have ever seen! 
They were poorly shucked, and I found bits of shell and/or sand in 11 out of 12 of them. 
The oysters were very ""fishy"" smelling and tasting, indicating they were perhaps not the freshest, and they tasted harsh and salty. No delicate flavour or texture at all. 
Then, they served them with some cocktail sauce, horseradish, and lemons, but no mignonette! 
I have never seen fresh oysters served without a mignonette sauce and when I requested some, they brought me tobasco. The other staff member I requested mignonette (after receiving the hot sauce instead the first time) had literally no idea what I wanted. It was nuts. 
The oysters were barely palatable and I recommend no one ever order them. 
The spinach salad was ok but literally consisted of some sliced apple and bagged spinach and they charged about $15 for it. Ridiculous. 

The service was adequate and our waiter was polite. That is about the only pleasant thing I can say regarding this establishment. 
If you are looking for fresh, quality oysters, (which they literally advertise) do not come here!!",2021-04-01 18:48:32

We had a half dozen of the chargrilled oysters to start. When these came out, I was immediately underwhelmed. The presentation was messy and did not match what I would expect based on the price. While the flavor was good, I would say there's much better chargrilled oysters elsewhere in the french quarter for the same price.

For entrees, we got the seafood pescatore (substituted the marinara sauce for scampi sauce) and blackened shrimp & jambalaya. The pescatore was great with the flavorful, slightly spicy scampi sauce and I highly recommend doing this sauce substitution. The jambalaya, unfortunately, was cold when it arrived at our table, but the waiter was nice enough to take it back to the kitchen and get a fresh one. It was flavorful, although a little dry.

We waited 30 minutes for a kids Mac n cheese, then an additional 10 minutes for the baked oysters, then 5 minutes later the kids hamburger came out. Those of you with kids understand what it may be like to wait with bored, hungry kids. I waited another 10-15 minutes for my chicken salad. After receiving it and a couple bites, I noticed the meat was raw.

The decor was bright and airy upstairs with the doors to the balcony open looking down on the street. We began with the red fish beignets which were excellent. Then I had the oyster pasta, but I substituted grilled shrimp as I wasn't in the mood for fried anything today. It was just ok - the pasta wasn't particularly fresh and I got a couple of small pieces of shrimp shell in there. The bread that came with it was stale on one side so I asked for more. In general, not a $20 pasta dish. 

The real disaster was my wife's dish. (I don't use that word lightly) She ordered the blackened red fish. The fish was lukewarm and the
green beans were cold. The beans were also limp, flavorless, and colorless. They said they were fresh, but we suspect they were frozen. Or at least cooked for so long they became sad little green ghosts of what they once were. Then there was the fresh crab add-on. Oh my. Dry, flavorless, and cooked beyond what any form of fish should be subjected to. 

She sent the dish back to be warmed up as she didn't want to make a fuss about the other problems. They said they would cook it all over again. But it didn't matter. The new dish was just as bad, and sad. 

The waiter was attentive and asked how it was and we were more specific. He then asked if we could express our concerns to the manager, which we did a few minutes later. They were both very apologetic and were kind enough to comp our desserts and gave us 15% off the whole meal. Classy. 

We understand some nights the kitchen isn't doing well or something's off, but they did the right thing to try to make up for it. It's not about the money to us. It's that they were willing to go beyond apologies and put their money where their mouth is. It says they do care and want to do better by us. After all, it's not a $30 meal we're paying for. We came to New Orleans for the great food, so restaurants have to and should be on their game.

Incidentally, the desserts were great. We also tipped well on the full price without the discounts. The server shouldn't lose for the kitchen's mistakes. I gave 2 stars for the food, but added a third just for the service from the server and the manager.",2016-06-06 02:37:23

We were a party of 7 there on Monday afternoon 12/28 around 1:30. We didn't need to wait too long for our table, but that's about as good as it gets.  We were sat upstairs and it took approximately 15 minutes before we were greeted by a server. After someone finally stopped by and asked if we had been helped, to which we answered no, said she ok, I'll just take care of you. She took our drink order and then turned us over to another server. Waters and sodas came out about 5 minutes later...but our beers took close to 20 minutes and that was only after we stopped our first waitress to ask. 
Food orders were then taken. After we asked our server for several suggestions, we should have paid for our drinks and left, she had nothing great to say about the menu. When asked about the gumbo, she said it was good as long as you added your own salt. What about the eggplant. She nods ""no"". Ok then what do you like. No answer. Perfect. We played it safe with soup, salads, and oysters.
55 minutes later. Lunch was served. 
Fifty-five minutes *later* we had our food. Ask me how we know how long it was? Because we had a phone call when the server was taking our order. Now, as we understand kitchens get backed up, but there were only 4 other tables filled. Just let us know if it's backed up. We're reasonable people.
But I digress. 
Food comes out. Food runner drops it off and then just, leaves. Thank goodness the host was walking by, saw what happen and gave us our stuff. 
Grilled oysters - barely warm. Closer to room temp. 
Salad - no dressing
French onion soup - very salty.
Dozen raw oysters - and I'm not even joking when I say this, received 12 shells and 11 oysters. Where did the other oyster go and how does one not notice that when shucking?
Food runner did come back with dressing and an extra oyster. So that was nice. 
Also we had to ask him because our waitress had pretty much become MIA. 
Figured we ask for the bill while still eating because, you know, time management. 
Had to yet again, find a different server to find our other server to get the bill.

Anyways, our server was great. He was really honest when we were asking for recommendations and for him to basically choose for us, which I greatly appreciated. I ordered the blackened chicken sandwich with a side of hush puppies, and for dessert I had the brownie a la mode.

I couldn't be happier that this was the first spot we chose to eat cause' the minute we rolled in we were treated to all that Southern hospitality and then some. 

I'm a big fan of sitting at the bar because I feel the view and the service are a little more special when you do. Royal was especially special because the bar is basically front of the house so you get to see all the action. Action as in drinks flowing and oysters shucking. Plus where do else can you get schooled on how to properly pronounce the city your chilling in. Norleans I was told and politely scolded. Get it right! 

I had some of the freshest, biggest and all around tastiest oysters, I've had in some time. My man treated us correct and made sure we were well taken care of. It was a party of four, sitting front and center, taking in all the Royal had to offer. 

We ordered a myriad of apps, from seafood mushrooms to eggplant chips, all of which were excellent. The star though for the apps was the crab claws and the broth they simmered in! Wow, this was a solid taste.  We then carried on to the main courses. Taste of New Orleans, shrimp and jambalaya and so on. All good here! The Royal could do no wrong and every bite was as good as the last. I would come here again in a heartbeat.

We sat at the bar where Anthony was the definition of Southern hospitality (and a pro at shucking oysters). The drink menu is extensive, but the Cajun Bloody Mary I ordered was a little disappointing (had to much of that steak sauce taste), and took a few minutes as the bartender seemed to be preoccupied. Everything after the drinks though was absolutely perfect.

The oysters were HUGE. I had oysters a few times in New Orleans and these were by far the biggest. Anthony shucked then right in front of us and they could not have been fresher. Throw on just a dash of Louisiana hot sauce and you're set.

The Shrimp Caprese was a great starter, a hefty amount of shrimp and a nice stack of mozarella and tomato was perfect for sharing.

I was a little hesitant to order alligator, but when in New Orleans you have to try it at some point, so I ordered the Alligator Po Boy, and my oh my was it fantastic. The Royal House doesn't mess around and keeps the Po Boy simple and classic the way it's supposed to be with just pickles, lettuce, tomato, and fried alligator on a French Roll. The alligator really does taste just like chicken, and don't be afraid to use that Louisiana hot sauce again. This sandwich ended up being one of the best, if not the best, things I ate in New Orleans.

So we were greeted by our server Terrance and he was so charming and awesome, he made great suggestions, but we declined and ordered what we had our hearts set for. I also received a free appetizer for checking in,( Thanks Yelp!) I picked the Spinach Artichoke Dip, which was amazing,  it was a little bit spicy, which was a nice take on a traditional dish. I really enjoyed the freshly fried tortilla chips. For my main dish I ordered the Royal House Burger with Cheddar and Bacon. The burger was cooked perfectly, and sized just right. I did feel as though my fries were a bit overcooked for my liking. And I wished I had went for the red bliss potatoes, over the deep fried , fast food style, french fries.

Charbroiled oysters, delicious. Again lots of garlic which I love.

Blackened shrimp and crawfish jambalaya was also pretty good but nothing spectacular, i would try something else next time.

Banana fosters cheese cake. - best thing i ate. Omg, so deliciously rich with banana and cheese flavor. Slight rum taste and i think the cheesecake base was pecan flavor.

We arrived on a Saturday late afternoon with no wait at all. I really wanted the balcony view, so requested a table upstairs outside. Unfortunately, the balcony at Royal House is incredibly slanted and narrow. As nice as the view was overlooking the streets below, I was fearing for anything accidentally getting dropped over the balcony. You're literally sitting at a 30 degree angle --kind of scary.

Anyways, we decided to order the Taste of New Orleans ($18) and Shrimp Creole ($18) to share. Since there was a free appetizer with a purchase of two entree deal on Yelp, we also added the Alligator Bites ($12). To start, the alligator bites were something new for us. It was a tiny little cup of fried bites that just tasted like fried meat --good, but nothing very special about it.

Now since this was our first stop, we knew the taste of New Orleans would allow us to try a little bit of everything. This sampler came with a cup of Chicken & Andouille Jambalaya, Crawfish Etouffee, and Chicken & Andouille Gumbo. Along with the shrimp creole, everything was served over a bed of steamed white rice. The rice here was so hard, which made it not as enjoyable. While the jambalaya was our least favorite, the gumbo and shrimp creole were solid choices. The real dish to get here is the crawfish etouffee though. This is the first time I have ever had crawfish etouffee and Royal House has had me hooked! I honestly wish we just got a full order of it instead. The creamy gravy was so whole-hearted with every bite. I'd highly recommend the crawfish etouffee here and anywhere!",2018-01-24 16:53:24

Our awesome waitress looked just like Kendra Wilkinson and was able to put up with my sister's boyfriend! Not many people can lol. She also warned me to not leave my phone or purse on the table because it could be swiped by the passing crowds. We were seated on the first floor near the open floor-to-ceiling doors. It was a nice view and I enjoyed the breeze.

We each ordered a different entree and sampled everything. Yum! Again if you are with a group the Royal house is a great choice due to the variety of the menu. My sister ordered the crawfish cakes (1 free app with yelp check in) and they were amazing! Left me wishing I had ordered those for myself. I was way too excited for my shrimp and grits, anyway.

Was greeted by the host who asked me if I wanted to sit in or on the balcony. It was hot but a nice breeze so I went up top. Up the stairs I was greeted by another wonderful host who was out going and happy welcoming me. He sat me down and told me my waitress would be right with me. Moments later the waitress came to take my order. There was so much stuff on the menu I wanted to try for the first time I didn't know what to do. Thankfully they have this Taste of New Orleans where you can sample 3 or 4 dishes. Try 3 for $18.00 or four for $22.00. I opted to try all four. The Cajun chicken & Andouille Jambalaya, Crawfish Étouffée, Red beans & rice, and Chicken Andouille Gumbo. 
My favorite was the Crawfish Étouffée.. Yummy yum yum. The Red Beans & Rice was so good and flavorful. The chicken Andouille Gumbo was delicious. My least favorite was the Cajun Chicken jambalaya. Which I was able to swap out for another bowl of the Étouffée. Great service. Great food. And the best was the view to overlook the street. I highly recommend as will return.",2021-06-20 21:19:05

The oyster duo (Rockefeller/Royale) was a good way to start the meal. Of the two, we preferred the Royale. We ordered two orders of fried alligator, as each order only had about 4 pieces. I would say it tastes like fried chicken, but a bit chewy. The redfish beignets (fried golden brown in tempura batter and finished with a Crystal beurre blanc sauce and cane syrup) were probably my favorite- crispy and flavorful. The Taste of New Orleans is a sampling of the city's most famous dishes: Chicken & Andouille Jambalaya, Crawfish Etouffée and Chicken and Andouille Gumbo. I didn't really care for any of them. 

The evening was fine until we got our bill. My friend had ordered a drink and asked for another shot to be added as it was weak. She was surprised to see her drink was almost $20. We asked our bill to be split between card and cash. When the waiter came back with my card, he had taken all of my friend's cash. Did he think he was getting a 50% tip?! Uh, no. When I politely asked him for the change back from the cash, he told me I needed to sign my receipt first and the bartender will handle the change. Ok...

Next I had the oyster platter, (yes i went oyster crazy that day). It came with fries, hush puppies, and sauce. The platter was really big and was more than enough I could eat.

This was by far the worst dining experience I've had in New Orleans. So many of the waiters clearly gave no fucks about spilling drinks and food ALL over the tables and floors and barely cleaning it up. We had to get up to ask for water multiple times, ask for utensils, ask for pens to sign the check...

The inside is decorated ornately and it has a historic, classy feel with the high ceilings you see so often in New Orleans architecture. The balcony would have been the ideal spot to sit and people watch below, but it was too hot the day we visited.

Our waiter let us know the best things on the menu. Get these:

-- The Crab Claws ($13.50): this appetizer is served up lathered generously with this amazing Cajun, creamy, garlicky sauce. The staff kept the dish on our table even after we were done because there was still some sauce left and they knew how good it is.

But we are living it up in NO as everyone should do, so our first order: FISH DONUTS! Well, that's what we like to call the Redfish Beignets. Oh lord, they were good! Thank the goddess of my waistline that they don't sell these anywhere near my house. We followed that with Crawfish Ravioli and a couple of Hurricane's to wash it all down. 

Then we watched the night skies cast changing colors over the city and savored our last sips with big smiles from ear to ear.",2016-11-22 03:00:33

We got the crawfish cakes ($10 lightly breaded and seasoned with crawfish tails topped with crawfish cream) for app. Then tried the Taste of New Orleans which included 
a sampling of Chicken & Andouille Jambalaya, Crawfish Etouffée and Seafood Gumbo. I wasn't a fan of the jambalaya - luke warm at best and not very flavorful. Crawfish etouffee was delicious and seafood gumbo had a slight kick. Both had lots of seafood in the dishes. We had also ordered the Creole shrimp. This was a much better dish than the sampler - hot, tastes fresh and the tomato based sauce was not as heavy as the cream based dishes. Portion was nice too with about 8 medium sized shrimps.

- The quality of the food is lacking. It seems like because this restaurant stays open late, people that come here may be a little intoxicated so they wouldn't know if they were eating something good. So, the people that work here just whip up something real quick which would totally compromise the quality of the taste in the food.
- I was really hoping the bread pudding would be good since the pics I saw on Yelp looked good, but it was below average in overall taste. My hubs and I actually ended up not finishing it.
- The bathroom needs to be updated. It just doesn't have that ""feng shui.""
- In order to use their WiFi, you must provide your email addy.

On the flip side, I did LIKE:

- How you can get a free app by checking in on Yelp (details apply)
- They didn't give me a hard time for bringing in and keeping my large luggage inside.

Royal House seated our group of five in no time! It's a casual place where you can sample some good New Orleans cuisine, especially seafood. My group raved about the oysters! I don't do oysters, but one newbie even enjoyed them. 

Service here is very friendly and relaxed. The oyster-dropping guy was clowning with our table, and I like that. Keepin' it realz, Royalz. Most of us were intrigued by the Taste of New Orleans Sampler of Gumbo, Etouffe, and Jambalaya. The Jambalaya was great, nice and spicy! I got the chicken and sausage gumbo, which was very good- and my dining partners subbed for the seafood gumbo, which they said was a alright, a little fishy. The Etouffe was the star of the sampler, and had little crawfish (crayfish, yadda yadda), in it. I'm not a fan of shellfish, but the broth, the tiny crawfish- everything about this was great!

Others in my group raved about the Shrimp Creole, and the Baked Seafood Tortellini in red sauce- which looked amazing!

Crab Claws: the pictures I saw associated with this meal showed large, beautifully juicy looking claws in a buttery sauce. What I received (pictures attached) was more like pinsers which were many bone with little meat. It was drenched in a creamy-sour sauce that reminded me of an over-spiced (yes, it's possible) thousand island dressing.

Cup of gumbo: I was really looking forward to a good cup of gumbo in NOLA. It was just ok. First of all, it came out lukewarm.Little to no flavor and a much more watery consistency than I am used to when it comes to gumbo. The gumbo itself wasn't bad actually, just not what I look for in gumbo.

Shrimp n Grits: again, The flavor was ok but not amazing. The grits seemed slightly undercooked to me, and the flavor was really overpowered by an overwhelming amount of Rosemary. The shrimp was well cooked and probably the best part of the dish. This dish also came out cold and I am not one to send things back AT ALL, but I had to request them reheat it. 

I think I may have come here on an off night because they have excellent reviews and some of their other pictures really looked great but unfortunately I can't strongly recommend eating here.

Manager said he was sorry and that was it.  I had a rating card in my bill, which I filled out and didn't hear anything from them.

Also had the taste of New Orleans which is a a quartet of jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, gumbo, and something else.  If you can, replace the jambalaya and the other unmemorable dish with more gumbo and etoufee which tasted out of this world.

The Jambalaya was room temperature and honestly, none of us could find any seafood in the bowls.  The only shining star was the red beans and rice...

The Chargrilled were the tasty highlight and a good temperature but the others were all luke warm at best  and the stuffing was more breading than seafood.... not good !

Simultaneously I had ordered.-- Seafood stuffed mushrooms...again a bit too much breading and there was no sauce that accompanied it..
When I asked for sauce the bartender had to go get some which actually took longer than expected and she brought me back a butter sauce ....
This just didn't work ---it wasn't the correct accent sauce .... And I was not overly anxious to acquire another sauce.

(Incidentally a patron next to me wanted some sauce for her sandwich and again the staff had to punch info into the computer and go back in the kitchen)

The taste of New Orleans was also awesome! It comes with gumbo, jambalaya, and crawfish étouffée. My favorite was the étouffée, followed by the jambalaya. The gumbo was just okay. But I would order this again because I like having all the variety when I'm eating. 

The oyster duo comes with 3 oysters Rockefeller (cheese and spinach topping) and 3 oysters royale (seafood cheese topping).

Street parking is rough, especially in NOLA. If you're having a hard time for parking, I'd recommend valet parking in a hotel nearby. The small restaurant has two floors. On the first floor, there is a full bar in the middle of the restaurant against a wall, with the restaurant surrounding the bar. We got seated first floor, and our waiter arrived promptly.

As a fellow Yelper to another Yelper, do not forget to check in. Although it states ""free appetizer"", the check in coupon is only worth $10 off any appetizer.

Food:
**Note: A Texas native, I was disappointed at the food portions. So happy everything is bigger in Texas ;)**
Fried Alligator (3/5, Marinated gator meat served with cocktail and tartar sauce): When in NOLA, you gotta 'gator. If you never tried alligator, it literally tastes like chicken but more fatty. Sizes were like mini popcorn chicken pieces. Frankly, I prefer the alligator I've tried in Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen. If I do come again, I'd use the check in coupon for the Crab Claws!

Chargrilled Oysters (2/5, Plump Louisiana oysters, fresh shucked, topped with our Parmesan butter cheese filling and then grilled to bubbly perfection): I've had better chargrilled oysters than Royal House's. These were disappointing, and we ordered 2 orders of these. It was inconsistent and dry. For some, you can still taste the oyster, but the others I tried tasted like straight up cheese.

Blackened Shrimp Jambalaya (3/5, A classic New Orleans rice dish. Chicken and andouille sausage sautéed with peppers and onions, then topped with blackened shrimp): This was probably the best out of the other 2 main courses we ordered. Pretty good flavor to me with good texture in the rice. Rice was not that wet/soggy texture. My friend mentioned she tried much better jambalaya though.

Oyster Pasta (2/5, Linguine pasta tossed with spinach and mushrooms in a scampi sauce and topped with fried oysters): My friend ordered this and probably came out 5+ minutes after we received the other two dishes. This was probably my least favorite because it was salty and dry to me. It gets a star for the 8 fried oysters though.

Shrimp Creole (3/5, Tender Gulf shrimp sautéed with peppers and onions in a spicy Creole tomato sauce served over a bed of steamed white rice): It was my first time trying Shrimp Creole. I'll say that I wasn't head over heels for it. It's tasty though with a good amount of flavor, which is not spicy like it was advertised. There were plenty of shrimp in this dish that I couldn't finish some. My friends ate them though!

Apparently, you get a 15% discount if you're a local. Service was ""eh"". Our waiter was friendly, but food took a while and didn't come out one after another. We had to wait for our friend to get the Oyster Pasta.

I cannot recommend the charbroiledd oysters enough!

Save up on your calories and carbs consumption so you can partake in this out of the world deliciousness! The po-boy was just A-OK, and it was a little too bready for our taste.

1.  GW FINS - only open for dinner so no bargains, but the finest dining alternative;

5.  CAFÉ SOULÉ - specializes in crab dishes, Antoine's family, classic atmosphere;
6.  DEANIE'S - if you want a menu heavy on fried... uh... everything, huge portions;
7.  MRB - if you can handle bar smoke the oyster & crawfish specials are a deal;
8.  ROYAL HOUSE - best atmosphere, outdoor seating, but touristy & a tad pricey;

12.  OCEANA - nasty dining room, wide but insipid menu, gougingly overpriced;

Big pieces I pulled out of my mouth were definitely shell.  One of the guys I was with couldn't even finish his--he was afraid of breaking a tooth!  I ordered the Taste of New Orleans for my entree and this was underwhelming.  The crawfish etoufee tasted more like the rice and beans you get at Popeye's.  The chicken and andouille jambalaya lacked decent size pieces of meat as did the gumbo.  Flavors were...ok.  This was a one and done for me.,2020-01-13 17:31:03

If you're going to dine here, I highly recommend sitting upstairs on the patio.  You get a gorgeous view of the French Quarter and there are tons of flowers and plant life.  As for the food, always and I mean always order the crab claws.  It comes covered in this gorgeous sauce that I could just drink from the bowl.  Without fail, we always ask them to keep it on the table so we can dip everything and anything in that sauce.  Other memorable dishes would be the crawfish etouffee and crawfish ravioli.  We destroyed it in seconds and I'm always wanting more.  I'm actually drooling thinking about it.

Night one- absolutely terrible experience. The food was delicious (we got the crawfish ravioli). The service, however, was completely atrocious. The food took FOREVER and the server chose to help everyone except our table. Once the food came, she never once checked on us. We ended up requesting a manager to let her know, and my friends said she saw the server ROLL HER EYES while we complained of the poor service. Whatttt? 

However Shirley, the manager, redeemed the 0 star review. She truly listened to us and offered us a free entree to make the experience better during our next visit. She was so incredibly kind and understanding and told us we deserve a true royal experience. 

However, I will say- the night 2 food was less than bragging -worthy. I got the fried oysters and could barely finish it because it was sooooo greasy. 

Overall, I'd say it wasn't the best and wasn't the worst. The 4-star is because of Shirley, the manager. Everything else was probably 0-1 star.",2019-04-19 20:58:07

The restaurant itself is in an amazing 100 year old building that oozes history and charm, & is in a nice corner location. Food was hot, excellent and fresh. Service was friendly & quick. Greg is probably the best waiter we had during our stay in New Orleans. Highly recommended!!!

APPETIZERS:
+Blue Crab Claws
+Bloody Mary
Verdict - If you like crab, this is the appetizer for you! Warm buttery crab claws already opened and ready to pop in your mouth. Bloody Mary was perfect after a shot of hot sauce!

ENTRES:
+Chargrilled Oysters
+Oyster Duo
Verdict -  If you've never had Oysters Rockefeller the Oysters Due is a good plate to try. The oysters Royal were excellent too. The star of the show hover was the chargrilled oysters. Chargrilled to perfection, the warm goodness was paried w/ a little garlic butter & parmesan. So simple yet so delicious...and thats coming from someone who doesn't enjoy raw oysters. Cannot recommend  enough.

Everything we ate was simply perfect. The atmosphere is outstanding...sitting in that historic French Quarter building, listening to the jazz music come in through the open doors...simply perfection...Get the chargrilled oysters...seriously.  Best in New Orleans and we tried them everywhere...Top notch service (Ask for Greg!)",2021-07-31 18:15:50

Even long-ER to get our appetizer. And longer still to get our food. And the food was very mediocre and not worth the wait. Our appetizer was pretty much the only good part of our visit. We ordered beers with our food and never got them, even though the waiter had a reminder. By the time he came by to ask how we were doing, we were mostly through eating,  and feared that by the time he brought them out, we'd be out of food. 

Then,  it took a long time again to get the ticket. And then the ticket was wrong and had to be sent back. So we had to wait again. 

Side issues that just compounded a bad visit: it was loud, the LSU game was turned off and waiter couldn't switch it back. And the manager never once checked on our table even though he had to have known we weren't happy and he walked by about 10 times.",2019-09-08 02:32:16

Do not eat here if you want to feel disrespected or have terrible service before you even step foot in the restaurant. While approaching the restaurant, me and my husband were the ones who greeted the host, not him, I believe his name is Obie from what we were told. He basically just pulled out the clip board and flipped the pages in our faces after we asked how long the wait time was. He said 20 mins and we were fine with that. He then asked for the name and asked US what time it was, so we let him know 8:30pm (give or take). We did not feel welcomed at all the way we were approached, but hey, it's Friday night, he probably had a long day so we weren't mad about, we were just hungry and wanted to enjoy our night and eat. BUT THEN... after waiting some time to be seated, a family of 5 approach and did not get the same interaction. He immediately communicated with the wait staff over walkie to see if there was a seat for 5. They waited BASICALLY NO TIME until they were seated upstairs... on the balcony.... How do I know? Because Obie proceeded to look right at us afterwards, tell us to follow them, and for US to tell the staff upstairs to seat us on the balcony. As we go upstairs, surprise there are no other balcony seats so we are sat at the bar.. in the corner. No big deal, we are hungry so we are going with the flow. NEXT BAD EXPERIENCE, we are given PLASTIC TO GO SILVERWARE instead of actual silverware while everyone around us is given actual silverware. I can see the other wait staff carrying the actual silverware in napkins to tables that were seated after us. We then left because I felt extremely unwelcomed and treated basically like a second class citizen based on the those interactions. I hate to bring race into it, but the family of 5 that got seated before us were White, my husband and I are Asian and we are not sure that COVID-scare racism could have been anything to do with it but I've never had an experience like that in my entire life that I had to walk out of an establishment. I usually brush things like that aside. But we told the bartender upstairs we were going to leave and she was the nicest person we had an encounter with. The host Obie however, not welcoming at all. I was a host a few years ago and I know how it can be, but being in that position before, it could have been handled better from the start. We called the restaurant to let the supervisor, John, know about our experience. He was even is aware about guests being given plastic silverware because staff are ""being lazy"". I don't get how you're aware yet still some of your staff does it to one group of people and other staff give actual silverware? I don't know. However, he was understanding about the situation, but that was the experience they gave us overall.",2021-07-17 03:24:11

The Chargrilled oysters didn't stand up to Acme's or J's seafood Dock. 
The oysters Rockefeller were over dressed and least favorite of the night.

It's usually difficult to get a group of people to agree on where to have dinner, especially when none of us are familiar with the area. However, I decided to take charge and select the dinner destination for us all. Royal House was the final decision and it was a good one!

Just like most of the restaurants located in the tourist areas of NOLA (french quarters, riverwalk, bourbon street, etc.) there was a line when we arrived and unfortunately they did not take reservations. So we waited for a least 30 - 45 minutes before being seated. I must say that the hosts and hostesses were really nice and kept us updated as we waited. 

Finally we were seated, the restaurant has the New Orleans, french quarter vibe and decor. Although the restaurant is not very big, they manage to utilize every square footage to its capacity. The two story restaurant has a nice bar area and balcony seating. 

Our waitress was very nice and knowledgeable of the menu. I chose to order the Seafood Pescatore, a linguine pasta with a marinara sauce, topped with clams, mussels, shrimp and scallops, seasoned in herbs and spices to perfection. It was really good!! It paired well with my glass of chardonnay.

Wait staff were fantastic and helpful.  
My wife had the chargrilled oysters and blech.  Not good at all.
I had the crab claws and I was expecting a couple big fat claws to be sitting on a plate.  NOPE.  A bunch of tiny mini claws with minimal meat but that is the dish.  Again, Blech. 
Neither one of us are big on seafood so again, please read this with caution.  Most of the reviews we read were very positive and apparently both of our dishes are highly rated.  That was one reason we ordered both and the other was based on the waitresses recommendation.  
To try and salvage the experience and move forward we ordered the banana foster cheesecake.  The Bananas were meh and the cheesecake had a fishy taste to it.  Was the chef mixing spoons or was the taste of our previous two dishes still lingering....a possibility.   Not a fan either way.

My friends and I stayed in the area for about a week, and trust me when we say we literally ate our way through New Orleans. Of everything, this was our favorite place of them all. So good that I even ordered a dozen chargrilled oysters to go home with me on the 4 hour plane ride back to California. *no shame*

TLDR;; this is the happiest place on earth, should be your #1 food stop in NOLA! And get the chargrilled oysters!!

From the hostess to the server to the bartender, everyone was so welcoming, attentive and just..so nice! For 3, we definitely got too excited since we ordered 18 oysters, 4 sides, an appetizer and an entree. Seriously, everything was amazing and did not disappoint. As a tourist, I wanted to try all the different types of food NOLA was known for, so I liked that Royal House didn't specialize in just one thing, and instead, had a good variety on their menu for us to pick from.

*Chargrilled Oysters: THE BEST in town!! I don't know what they do, but it was just enough Parmesan, garlic and all the goods on top of a perfectly grilled oyster. Will make you switch over from being a raw oyster fan

*Raw Oysters: Fresh, large and shucked right in front of you! What else could we ask for?

* Crab Craws Appetizer: Oh man, the crabs are so fresh and meaty, and the sauce is to die for!!! 

*Taste of New Orleans: 3 small cup-bowls of Jambalaya, Crawfish Etoufee, and Chicken/Andouille Gumbo--if you're new to the area like I was, this will give you a sample of the popular dishes of NOLA!

After walking around all day, we were ready to sit, and wanted a drink. We passed Royal House, noticed that there were tables open on the balcony and our decision was made. 

The host who helped us upstairs was great. Our interaction lasted maybe 45 seconds, but he had me laughing as he went through his whole spiel of the only rule being that we can have whatever we want as he let us pick out our table. Very nice guy, and he set the tone for great service. This was continued through our server, who took great care of us even though our ticket price was probably a bit lower than people having a full meal. Great customer service, all the way.

Now for food, we did get a bit to much on. We had a dozen oysters and fried alligator bites. Both were tasty. The portion size for the gator was tiny, but I think that's to be expected. The oysters were quite large and delicious! I cannot recall the price any more, but it was definitely reasonable. A bottle of champagne rounded things out, which I think cost somewhere in the high $30s, again reasonable.

I think what made this experience stand out for me was the great people watching of the balcony. We had front row seats to not only a magician but also a really great bluegrass band. I don't get a lot of street performance back home, so I definitely get a kick out of it when traveling to places like New Orleans. And personally, I think the best view to watch the French Quarter shenanigans is from above.

My complaint: I feel that they make the servers work a section upstairs AND downstairs. Which makes it impossible for them to keep track of the food is coming out on time or if anyone at the table needs anything as simple as silverware. So my lack of 5 stars lies on the management. We saw multiple people in the seating area waiting on something and that's due to spreading their staff thin,2020-02-16 02:02:30

Royal House is appealing to a NOLA tourist. Outdoor seating on the balcony, overlooking a beautiful area. They have creole and Cajun cuisine. They have great reviews. Right?

We arrived on a Saturday afternoon around 1. Behr hostess put our name down for 15-20 minute wait for the balcony. One person was ahead of us. She was friendly and kind. Several people were lining up and didn't want to take the free seats they had inside - they wanted to wait for the balcony.  After 20 minutes a manager walked over and whispered something to the hostess. She offered us a seat inside and said it was going to be another 20 minutes. We were insistent that we wanted the balcony. She kept trying to sell us on an inside seat saying we'd have to wait even more time. We wouldn't budge. Within a second she told us a table was ready on the balcony. Lame tactics to fill tables inside. 

We were seated by another kind staff member. The balcony is scary. It's awesome. But it's scary. It's slanted and not really supported by additional columns under it. We sat on a corner above a dumpster and it smelled like trash the whole time. That's New Orleans I guess. We got to people watch and take in the beautiful day though. We checked in and got a free app. 

We went with the crawfish cakes. They were good but the dish they were served in was dirty and the presentation was poor. They were like mushy cakes of seafood. Nothing to write home about. Nothing too bad.  My husband and I both ordered a half shrimp half fish platter. When the dishes came out (on dirty plates) there were several issues. 

A nice long strand of hair accompanied my cole slaw. I immediately found the waiter and sent it back. He was apologetic. As a manager made his way over I realized I didn't get any hush puppies with my dish either. The manager apologized - he offered me a free drink or dessert. I declined - probably the first person in all of New Orleans to turn down a drink. 

Our meal was horrible. We would have had a better meal at Popeyes. The batter on our shrimp and fish was thick and bready. There was no flavor. The fries were average frozen French fries. Hush puppies were burnt and tasted like old fryer oil. 

Everyone was kind. Everyone was trying to provide good service. Our waiter was nice and friendly. 

Man. We were disappointed. The food is seriously lacking and things didn't come together. Forget the hair. I can forgive a mistake. But the food wasn't even worth forgiving it for. Go sit on the balcony(not by the trash) and have a drink. That's it.",2016-02-22 03:07:12

Seafood is definitely a big part of New Orleans, so naturally I ventured out to the French Quarter area full of dining options.  I really didn't plan to dine at Royal House, somewhat ran into the place while strolling around looking for the next photo opportunity.  It turned out to be a French Quarter gem with a classic New Orleans atmosphere and menu featuring delicious seafood dishes.

Anyone with admiration for oysters would go bonkers here, from fresh-shucked to charbroiled, you're sure to find your favorite oyster dish here. I opted out and had fish instead, just didn't crave them that night.  I ordered the blackened Redfish topped with sautéed jumbo lump crab.  The super fresh fish was coated with Cajun seasoning served with roasted bliss potatoes and corn.  The meal was absolutely delicious, the Cajun flavor was exactly what I wanted to taste, perfect kick with every bite.  The added crab provided a nice balance to the flavor.

The staff was very polite and assisted me with the menu.  Noticing my camera, she recommended that I make it to the top floor where I could take some photos from their balconies.  It was obvious they were paying attention.  The ambience was very welcoming and didn't have that tourist trap feel, a nice local vibe.  The interior decor was classic with dim lighting throughout.  If you prefer a brighter atmosphere, request a table on the second floor where the endless windows illuminate the dining area or even sit on the balcony.  Although I felt a bit clustered on the balcony due to its narrowness.  I enjoyed it thoroughly, even with so many places in the area, I felt like I chose the perfect place.",2014-08-14 04:05:46

Service was slow and after spilling water on us, we didn't get anything comped or offered to us. 

Food: The most memorable thing was the crawfish étouffée. Delicious! The crab claw appetizer was good but it was mostly sauce.

People have recommended different restaurants to me for crawfish étouffée, but my fiancé doesn't eat seafood (crazy, I know), so we chose Royal House because they serve burgers (lol). With that said, if you too are in the area and are with someone that doesn't like seafood, Royal House serves up a pretty decent burger, and they also have roast beef po boys as well as another chicken dish. It's clear that their specialty is seafood, though.

Anyway, the crawfish étouffée was served with crawfish two ways-sautéed in the gravy and fried crawfish tails. It was super flavorful, and the texture of the crawfish was great too. The portion size was also perfect-I usually never finished my food but I ate every last bite of my dish and felt comfortably full without feel overstuffed. This is only the second time I've had crawfish étouffée, but I'm so glad we chose Royal House because my dish truly exceeded my expectations.

I've never tried oysters before, but they (obviously) have different oyster dishes as well that are good for splitting. Next time I come back will be with a seafood eating friend so I can try some of their other dishes.

Lastly, we came on a busy Saturday afternoon but were seated super quickly. Our server was also very knowledgeable and friendly, and I was surprised at how fast we received our food given how crowded it was.

Located in the center of the French Quarter, parking can be a little hard for Royal House. However, don't let that deter you from coming to eat here. We began with the crab claws appetizer (which we received free by checking in on Yelp -- thanks Yelp!). Our waitress recommended them and although at first we almost didn't go with them, we are glad we did. The claws come ready to eat and covered in a lemon butter sauce with garlic bread. The sauce is so great that we wiped the plate completely clean. I would say this appetizer is the perfect size for two people.

We also shared charbroiled oysters with Parmesan and lemon drizzled on top. These oysters are a must try and will leave you wanting more. We got a dozen for two people and six definitely left us wanting more. The oysters were large and fresh and just the right amount of flavor. 

We then ordered the New Orleans Sampler which comes with a cup of jambalaya, craw fish etouffee, and gumbo. We ordered a side of red beans and rice to try it as well. These portion are a little less than a cup so you'll get to try it all. If I had to come back and order again though I would have only gotten the drafish etouffee and the red beans and rice. Those were by far the two best dishes in the sampler. 

Finally we caved in and decided to try the bread pudding for dessert. It was deliciously warm and came with ice cream on top. Definitely the perfect way to end this meal.

I would say if you're coming to visit 1. don't forget to check in for the free appetizer and 2. order food to share! Royal House has so many great options that you'll want to try as much as you can. 

Can't wait for our next visit to Royal House!",2016-08-26 17:44:48

We ordered crab claws, fried alligator, gumbo, taste of New Orleans, and their brownie dessert. Overall the food was pretty good. The crab claws has a great sauce which we dipped our bread in and ordered extra bread. The fried alligator tasted exactly like chicken, we wouldn't have been able to tell the difference if we were aware that we were ordering gator.  The taste of New Orleans came with 3 small bowls of gumbo, chicken and sausage jambalaya, and crawfish etouffee. Of the 3, the best was the crawfish etouffee which was perfectly seasoned. The gumbo was not bad but I don't have much to compare it to. Their jambalaya was nothing special. Lastly, the brownie dessert came with ice cream and strawberries, but overall was standard dessert.

Service was good but a little slow. The restaurant was on the busier side when we arrived for lunch.

Matter of fact they were so damn good I did another 1/2 dozen...the shucker was reading my mind and when he saw how fast that dozen was going down he knew I was gonna want some more so when I was about 9 in we kinda had this telepathic moment and just made eye contact...no words exchanged and BAM! there was another 1/2 dozen of them perfectly sized bi-valves!!

Like many other reviews state, you will definitely be waiting a long time from when you get seated to when a server will come up to your table to take your order (or even bring you water!!). It almost seems as though there is no system for what tables servers are responsible for, which makes it very easy to lose track of newly seated customers.

The food was a HUGE disappointment. We ordered the Gulf Fish Beignet appetizer that we got for free by checking in on Yelp.

The staff were very nice and the waitress really sweet. 

 We got our first round drinks and the appetizers after a normal wait. The spinach dip with crab and raw oysters were delicious. The lukewarm gumbo tasted off, like a masked burnt taste. But, we watched other tables seated after us get their entree food served while we waited and waited.

Our order was forgotten. Our Redfish platter and fried alligator came out warm like it was sitting out for awhile. The Rockefeller oysters was hot. We tried cancelling our crawfish ravioli but was insisted it was coming out. By the time we were to just stand up and leave, it finally appeared. It took over an hour for it to appear. Everything was ordered at the same time and it was a let down. Our group loves to eat and drink so to only have one round of drinks and food coming out lukewarm was a huge disappointment.  We would've ordered 3-4 more rounds of drinks. Lost money there for the business.

Our waitress was sweet but seemed overwhelmed. While other tables had the big trays being carried with all their food come out, our waitress was bringing 2-3 dishes out every so often. Which is probably why some of our food was room temperature.

Let me start by saying I use to be a Chef so I'm very lenient and understanding on lapse in service and mistakes as long as you make things right.  I finally got seated and it took 20 minutes to get water and since it took so long decided to throw in our full order as we could see this was gonna be a a process to get our order.  I'm looking around for our waiter, which I have no clue his name because he didn't say or care to introduce himself or talk at all after our order.  I see him notice we are looking and he has a shocked look on his face.  I know that look it's the look of holy sheet I forgot to put the order in. Mind you that's another 30 minutes in.  So we get our order 15 minutes after that. My fiancé ordered Redfish which was good.  I ordered The Sampler and 3 of the 4 items were cold.  I mention to our waiter that it's cold and he takes my plate with no explanation to the back and comes back 5 minutes later with the sampler after they microwaved it, not remade just microwaved.  So at this point. Now we are 70 min into dinner and I'm sitting there looking at a microwaved meal.  I only ate a few bites because the food was still not hot just like warm!!!!!!!  So I just want my check and I want to leave. So I set my timer to see how long this takes after the waiter knew I was displeased with the food and ignoring me.  It took another 15 minutes to check out and I had to get out of my seat and stand around the dining room till I could flag him down.  I'm now 85 min from seating to check out for 4 bowls of microwaved rice!  So I'm writing this eating beef jerkey in my hotel room wondering wth went wrong?

She recommended the crab claws for appetizers and it was delish! The bread was nicely toasted and cut thick enough to hold the crab before biting into it. The sauce was flavorful and light and we ended up eating all of it.
My sister got the shrimp and grits. The grits were fluffy and in small mounds topped with the sauce and shrimp. The sauce was similar to the one in the crab claw so of course it was wonderful. There was a good amount of shrimp and every bite had a shrimp.
I got the oyster po boy. The bread was crispy yet fluffy and it didn't hurt biting into the French bread like other places where I'm from (California). I didn't need to add any sauces as the oyster fry wasn't dry AT ALL. The fries here are amazing - nice and crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.
My husband got the fish fry. It is a lightly battered cat fish and it's worth a try. Soft and fluffy packed with a lot of flavor. It also comes with fries, which has become my favorite. 

The portions here are well worth the price. Most of us ended up having some left over. As you may have noticed, I used ""fluffy"" to describe most of the food...which is pretty accurate.

My friend went for it and got the crab claw appetizer ( i didn't try it since I have a shellfish allergy). It's small crab claws in this Cajun creamy sauce., she sopped up every bit of it with her bread so it must've been good.

It wasn't bad, but I probably wouldn't order again (tried it once, don't need to try it again). 

The taste of New Orleans trio was delicious--each dish was super flavorful and unique. Our favorite was the etouffee, which had strong seafood notes. However, as we were eating it, we discovered that there was a sugar packet/wrapper in it. I'm not sure if it fell into our bowl or if it had been in the pot and ladled out into our bowl, or what happened.  We flagged down our waitress to let her know, and were a little thrown off guard when she asked us what we would like to happen (we both thought it would be her job to take charge of the situation). After a pause, she offered to bring us a new etouffee or a whole new trio, and we asked for just a replacement etouffee since the other dishes were fine. She brought a new etouffee, apologized for the situation, and checked in on us again to make sure we didn't have any other findings in the new bowl. Also, ultimately she ended up not charging for the taste of New Orleans because of it happening, but unfortunately, the experience was just tainted from finding that in our food.

Kind of disappointing as we love oysters with crusty bread. 

Things went downhill from there when I ordered shrimp and grits. I got one small scoop (yes, a scoop, like hard mashed potatoes) of grits and then the whole thing was covered in this spicy red sauce that completely overpowered the entire dish. There were plenty of shrimp, but if the grits had Gouda cheese in them, I couldn't tell. I was just very disappointed with what is normally one of my favorites anywhere else in New Orleans. 

My husband had the red beans and rice and it was mainly rice and sauce. He was ok with it, but it was not the least he'd ever had. 

I know we came in later, but if your hours are until 10 and we arrive at 9, I should still expect the same experience as if I showed up at 6.

The music blares so loud so be prepared to scream act your dinnermate. It's like they are trying distract you from the food and atmosphere. The food took a very long time to make it to our table. I love NOLA but this place was horrible. The waitress didn't take my order until the last minute. I find it rude to watch staff sit, eat, and drink while I wait on my food. They gave us so much grief about sitting 6 adults and 3 children. My gumbo was cold!! The burger patty was so tiny and burnt and the waitress did not care. She said ""I'll just send the manager"" She did not even try to address the problem. I think she was ready to go home. I wish I could give zero stars. This was an absolute bad experience.

Drinks took a bit to come out but once they did the food arrived shortly thereafter. We started with the Fried Alligator appetizer which was alright, and moved onto Oysters on the Half Shell. Now the size of the oysters are impressive, but being where I'm from in Vegas, and I don't know if this is just a snobby Vegas thing but the oysters in Vegas are extremely clean. These oysters were sandy and had shell
Pieces. I guess that's because they are shocked right before they reach the table to preserve freshness. They indeed were very fresh, just different from what we are used to. For the entree, we finished with the ""Taste of New Orleans."" This includes four bowls consisting of Gumbo, Red Beans, crawfish etouffee and jambalaya.

There were 5 of us total. Seated immediately. I had a Bloody Mary which was tasty as always. Love the pickled green beans. Of course I ordered a dozen raw oysters for my meal which were amazing as always. My husband ordered the fried shrimp Poboy which he said was good but there was barely any shrimp on it which is the only reason this doesn't have 5 stars. My son got the Mac and cheese off the kids menu and it was super tasty. The oldest daughter had the grilled chicken Caesar salad which she devoured and said was awesome. But the real star of the show, hear me out, was my stepdaughters chicken strips. HOLY MOLY. They were amazing. She didn't care for the ranch so she asked for honey mustard and oh my gosh.

Our waiter, Chris, was incredibly knowledgable about the menu and gave us his suggestions on everything. We went with most of them and he was definitely right! My mom got the Voodoo Juice and I got the Mint Julep.  Delicious. Next, with Yelp checkin, we ordered our free appetizer per Chris' suggestion. The redfish beignets were insanely delicious. That crystal beurre blanc sauce and cane syrup was so good and the beignets were so light and flavorful. For my entree, I got the pecan crusted mahi mahi, also at his suggestion. Once again, incredible crystal lemon butter cream sauce. So delicious. Finally, we finished with the bananas foster cheesecake. It's a deconstructed cheesecake but boy is it good. The cheesecake is so light and fluffy. The homemade cinnamon graham cookie is perfect - and there's a ton for people who love extra crust. The whipped cream was also delicious.

Where to begin....

We've been here twice now since coming to NOLA and each time has been amazing. Our waitress Naudia (sp?) Was great and very helpful. I recommend checking in on the Yelp app so that you get a free appetizer (up to $12). We started with the crab claws, I believe they were $13.50 but we only had to pay $1.50 since the check in saved us $12. They were absolutely TO DIE FOR. The sauce is insanely flavorful! Tons of crab claws as well. Make sure to ask for extra bread.. you'll need it to dip into the sauce!

Waitress recommended the crawfish ravioli with crab meat for our entree. Both the BF and I never really opt for crawfish but decided to try it out. It was delicious. Just the right amount of portion of heat mixed with tons of creole flavoring and crawfish. I would absolutely order this again and I would say this was probably one of our favorite meals of the trip.

We'd just eaten beignets but I couldn't resist ordering the crab claw appetizers. $12 for fresh crab claws sautéed in a lemon butter garlic sauce served with french toast for dipping.

My husband and I got in line for dinner here at 8 pm and were not seated until well after 10 pm. The employees did not have any regard for the people waiting hours in line. There was loud commotion the entire time, with people heckling us etc. NO FOOD is worth standing 2 hours in swamp weather with sore feet, needing to use bathroom, etc. 

Once we finally got inside, things got even worse. I went to use the restroom and it was dirty; I saw a waitress in the restroom and informed her that there was no toilet paper. She shrugged and did nothing. I had to tell other ladies in line to use paper towels because the staff wouldn't refill the toilet paper. 

We ordered entrees and waited another hour for them- I think we finally got dinner at 11pm. My $18 ""taste of New Orleans"" included lukewarm gumbo, cold crawfish etouffee, and slightly tolerable jambalaya. My husband's $16 shrimp po boy was stale and the fries obviously microwaved. The entire meal had the taste and texture of something that had been hastily microwaved.

Take it from me and don't come here, especially if there is a line. Not worth it in the least, I wasted $50 and feel awful about it. The place is a mess, service was spotty, there was no element of hospitality, etc. 

My biggest advice if you're going our to the French Quarter/Vieux Carre in the evening: either eat beforehand in a different neighborhood or secure reservations beforehand (go to Arnauds, Felix's or Antoines instead of this place!!)

This place is a great place to hit up when you are in Nola. I was expecting better quality food given the star rating, but this place is A-okay.

My mom and I had the taste of New Orleans which is a trio of jambalaya, gumbo, and crawfish with rice. My favorite out of the three sample sized portions was the crawfish. 

The sauce was so tasty and had just enough spice to get my taste buds jumping. The rice was a bit harder than I expected it to be. At first I thought it was just mine but turns out my mom's dish also came with harder than expected rice. It was chewable but not fluffy soft rice. Maybe because there was so much gravy underneath it and they expect the rice to blend in with the sauce? In any case, for $17 it was a good meal. 

I didn't get a chance to have a drink but from what I saw the menu had interesting cocktails and a good variety at good prices between $10-$13. 

The service was great and the waiters and staff are very very friendly and accommodating. The restaurant is not huge but they make do with the space they have. There is a cool huge slanted mirror near the entrance where the bar is and gives the restaurant a cool dive bar feel.

Waited in line for about 1 hour due to short staff in the kitchen (understable!). Food took another 30 mins but it's okay since they were still hot.  I got French onion soup, chargrilled oyster, and blue claw appetizer. 

French onion soup: 8/10- The display looks soooo good and the cheese on top was chef's kiss. However the reason why it's not a 10 is due to its heavy salted onion and soup. When I say heavy, I meant heavy sodium. I had to pour about a cup of water little by little to dilute it. Unfortunately, it made my soup cold lol. 

Chargrilled oysters 4/10: small but I assume it's from the heat. The grainy cheese (don't know what it is called) made it so salty. I wish they put less like what some people were saying below. I tried Desire's chargrilled oysters and theirs were juicy. These were dry and salty enough where you can't taste the natural sweetness. They also toasted the bread so much that It felt like eating crackers- no softness at all. It was hard to enjoy the overall dish. Maybe try their raw oysters instead. 

Blue crab claws 8/10: again, this appetizer was great however it was so salty and sour. I used the Yelp offer (for appetizers $13 and paid the difference which was like $5). 

Good service. Overall I think they can improve the amount of salt they put in their dishes! (Or maybe let your waitress know to put less sodium in ur dishes.) This was mentioned in few reviews and I hope feedbacks are passed down to the Chefs. I hope to retry their French Onion Soup the next time I visit NOLA.",2021-12-29 01:37:51

My cousin had red fish beignets . Yes , you heard right. Red fish is a hearty fish, I would say similar to cod? What Royal House has done is dip it in sweet batter and fired it. It's not for everyone , but if you're looking for something different, here you go. My cousin also had some delectable-looking charbroiled oysters that were covered with melted Parmesan cheese. I personally had a spinach salad with a perfectly mixed balsamic vinaigrette, chopped apples, goat cheese and pecans. It was what I needed, when I needed it. You can , of course, add meat to your salad if you choose for an upcharge. 

Tip: When you go ask to sit upstairs if you can. It's a great view of the streets , cozy, and there's balcony seating .

They have a limited number is seats on the balcony, although I would not suggest siting there. The balcony leans and feels unsteady. Service was hospitable, but the main draw is the food.


Sidenote: DO NOT ORDER the Blackened Chicken sandwich! Period. When you hear blackens I think charred deliciousness.. unfortunately this is not that. It was grilled chicken w/ no seasoning.

He seemed to hate his job as he just didn't cut it foR us. 

Anyways, the food here honestly sucked. And I hate to give bad reviews but it really did and I spent so much money for my birthday celebration. We got a dozen oysters which were not fresh, they were small and not soaked and cleaned. You can taste all the sand and shell bits in the oysters. They didn't give us utensils with the oysters so we were using our forks just to grab some of the cocktail and horse radish sauce. We asked for lemon//lime for the oysters and the server never brought it. We got two gumbo which was okay but not authentic. The half/half special oysters were just too much. Like you couldn't even taste the oysters cos there were too much toppings to even taste anything. The jambalaya was good. It was nicE and hearty. The ribeye wAs also really good, but the sides to the ribeye was over cooked and soggy vegetables. We also got snow crab legs at $30lb and thEy we're not fresh. They were old and just plain bad.

Found this place on Yelp and decided to stop in. I'd say it's Italian with a Cajun and Creole twist. It's also a historic building in the French Quarter. We sat on the upstairs outside balcony. 

To drink, my boyfriend had Maker's Mint Julip. It was supposed to consist of Maker's Mark Bourbon, Muddled Mint, Simple Syrup, Soda. After ordering our waiter said they were out of Maker's Mark and asked if Crown Royal was okay...which it was. My boyfriend said the drink was good and different. 

I had Voodoo Juice. Cruzan Aged Light Rum, Banana Liquor, Blue Curacao, Pineapple And Orange Juices. It was just okay. 

To eat....

We started with alligator bites for an appetizer. Marinated Gator Meat Served With Cocktail And Tartar Sauces. It was very tender and had good flavor. 

For entrees we ordered and shared Crawfish & Crabmeat Ravioli and Baked Gulf Shrimp Tortellini. 

Crawfish & Crabmeat Ravioli- Jumbo Ravioli Filled With Lobster, Shrimp, Spinach & Ricotta, Topped With Creamy Louisiana Crawfish Sauce And Sautéed Blue Crabmeat. DELICIOUS. Nice pieces of seafood and lots of yummy melted cheese. Huge raviolis. Amazing flavor. 

Baked Gulf Shrimp Tortellini- Gulf Shrimp Tossed In A Seafood Cream Sauce And Topped With Toasted Buttery Bread Crumbs, Then Baked To Golden Perfection. YUMMY!!! What a wonderful marriage of flavors. 

Food was delish. Service on the other hand wasn't terrible but needs improvement. Our waiter was very slow in taking our order, even when we told him we were ready to order he said that he had to go down to the bar. He then took a very long time to come back to take our order.

The place was hopping.  Servers were swept off their feet.  Despite the cold weather, some people opted to sit outside on the balcony, as trays were being carried up the stairs to them!

We shared the fried fish platter, crawfish étouffée, gumbo and jambalaya. Nothing really stood out.  The gumbo and jambalaya were not served hot.  A big no-no for me.  I would rate the food as just ok as I've definitely had the same dishes better elsewhere in the city.  Not sure if this was due to the holiday kitchen schedule...

Now I wish I could remember our ponytailed, Cajun waiter's name, because he was absolutely hysterical. Alex, maybe? Anyway, each time he checked on us (which was often, to refill our drinks), he came equipped with a new gag about Boudreau! 

Food was excellent. We had a steak dinner that evening, so we decided to sample all of the oyster platters as share plates. The Rockefeller and chargrilled were by far the winners of the bunch. Could have done without the Maque Choux as the creamed cornesque topping dominated the taste over the oyster.

I am a noob when it comes to Cajun/Creole food and the only ""Cajun/Creole"" food I've had is Boiling Crab up in The Bay. So what better place to have that type of food than in the South.

-Taste of New Orleans (Jambalaya, Crawfish Étouffée, and Gumbo): A really good sampling platter of staple NOLA foods. The gumbo was definitely my favorite and helped tone down the spices of the other two. All three foods go very well together and balance out all of the flavors. It also is a good serving size where you will be full, but not uncomfortably so. It's a lot of rice though so be prepared for that, and they also give you three slices of toasted bread to go with it so it's very carb-heavy.
-Seafood Pescatore: Absolutely delicious. Really good variety of seafood inside of it, nice cream-based sauce, and good portion size as well. It wasn't too heavy or greasy like a lot of other seafood pastas end up being. My friend ordered this and I had a few bites - almost wished I had ordered this instead! 

Service: 9/10
-Very fast, accommodating, and friendly.
-Really decent pricing.

Atmosphere: 7/10
-Felt a little unclean and smelled a little weird (maybe like...old seafood). 
-Lively and bright inside.

Loved this place, thought the food was very well-seasoned and cooked, and would definitely return again!",2017-01-04 01:00:13

I grabbed food at the bar and sipped on a well-made Hurricane :) Maybe it was my selection (parmesan garlic oysters and crab legs), but I found the sauce accompanying the crab legs to be too salty and the portion size itself to be exceptionally small. For my first dish, I got Parmesan garlic oysters which were delicious on principle, but probably overkill because it was hard to taste the oysters themselves.

I guess maybe if you're favorite places are Red Lobster, Chili's and Applebee's, you may like the food here. But if you consider yourself a ""foodie"", outwardly or closeted, you do not want to waste a calorie or dime here.

The waitress we had was such a sweetheart, so I have nothing bad to say about the waitstaff. It's 100% the food as the reason why I wouldn't recommend a visit here.

The best thing we had here was the Chargrilled Oysters. They were actually quite good. But, because of the ambience (seemed kind of dirty, unorganized), I was afraid to eat Oysters here in fear of getting the dreaded ""bad oyster"".

I ordered the shrimp and grits, which were too gritty, not smooth as you'd expect. The shrimp was overcooked. And, there was some seriously weird flavoring in it. I doused it with Crystal Louisiana hot sauce, but I think that just made it even more gross. I didn't finish it.

My husband had the Taste of New Orleans. It must have been the Taste of New Orleans right from the trash in the streets of the French Quarter. Each ""taste"" came in 1 of 3 soup cups, and I really think it had to be the same bland gravy with chunks of old seafood floating in it. Not good. It's a good thing that we had enough delicious food in New Orleans that we knew this wasn't a fair representative of what NOLA is capable of. 

Unfortunately, we also ordered the hush puppies. They tasted like they were very old and maybe even refried a few times to heat them up.

We were finally taken upstairs and they kindly seated us outside. Someone came and took our drink order but then didn't come back for quite some time.

We had to go inside to find her to request the check. We were even understanding about the length of time to prepare our food, as there were several large parties. But when it arrived, the oysters were so overcooked they were hard and shriveled up and the bread slices were cooked practically to charcoal. The sauce on the crab claws was barely warm. No one ever came to check for more drinks or even water.
This was the second time we have eaten at Royal House and on the whole this was very disappointing. Even making allowances for the busy day, our experience should've been better than this.

We should have walked away again when we had to wait another 15 mins before a server came by. In fact, my boyfriend had to flag down the hostess to find our server.

I chose the shrimp and grits, which was my first time ordering this dish anywhere. I have nibbled on my bf's plate once or twice at another restaurant, but never ate more than a few bites anywhere. It was MARvelous! Shrimp was a plentiful, and cooked really. The grits were SUPER creamy, because how else do you want them? What really took it over the top for me was this sauce that we accidentally received. My bf wanted to substitute a side, and our server had to ring in something in order to 'upcharge' us. The price of this accidental sauce, I think it was called Royal sauce, covered the upcharge, but the kitchen accidentally made the sauce and the food runner accidentally brought it out. It was creamy, perhaps like a rose/blush sauce, and had seafood in the sauce. It was ridiculous and I poured that shit all over my grits! If you read this, order the grits and ask for the Royal sauce on the side (make sure that it's creamy and seafoodey and that I have the right name). Trust me, it's worth it to try to ask and it's worth the upcharge!

I really liked that they had a Yelp check in offer; I didn't see any other restaurants in the area catering to us like that. Our free app choice was the crawfish cakes, a popular choice. The cakes were really good. Not as amazing as our dinner, but very yummy. 

Lastly, the balcony provided a nice atmosphere. It had all the upsides of eating outside, and it was far enough away from the street to avoid smelling the French Quarter while dining. :) I do want to warn you that the balcony does not = elegant. It's super casual, tables are very small, and the balcony structure has a very noticeable slant that made me maybe slightly nervous.",2014-08-22 14:16:14

She was so fabulous that I would return here even if the food was terrible, just for her.

Luckily the food is not terrible. When you check in on yelp, you get $10 off of an appetizer. My boyfriend and I got crab claws, which came with some garlic bread to run through the incredible buttery sauce. A passing waiter brought us some more bread as well, just because he saw us enjoying it. Such great service.

Will had the pecan crusted mahi mahi for his entree, and he loved it. He couldn't get over how good the potatoes were that came on the side. I had the seafood pescatore, which came with clams, mussels, shrimp and scallops of linguine. Cindy recommended that I swap out the marinara for the scampi sauce, and holy crap was she right. It was the best sauce ever. So good, and the pasta was loaded with seafood. Worth every cent.

Cindy talked us into ordering dessert as well. We split the bread pudding, which is loaded with raisins, a white Frangelico sauce, whipped cream, and a strawberry. It was so good.

I have so few things that I can say that are bad about Royal House. The food was all very tasty, you get a discount for your appetizer, and I had the best waitress ever.

OTEMsXbrrUQl_AVRjjGpZQ,yr0Rr1UGI_5fJZyJbzjb9A,VQcCL9PiNL_wkGf-uF3fjg,2,1,0,0,"So let me start off by saying, I almost felt compelled to write a review because it was such a BIZARRE EXPERIENCE. If you check on my profile I usually only leave reviews if I give the business 5 stars, so this review is my first ""bad"" one since joining Yelp. Let me just say, my BF and I are from Los Angeles and this is MY first time visiting NOLA and my BFs second time. Since we've gotten here I've been pleasantly surprised with how good the food is this town (staying in the french quarter). 

HOWEVER...last nights experience was our first ""bad"" dining experience since arriving here in NOLA. Had to happened sometime....its been 3 days after all. 
SOOO first, let me just say that I'm not here to bash anyone. I completely understand that waiters/waitresses/bartenders (and so on)  are people with real emotions and are imperfect! Yes, I get that, believe me. The criticism I have, isnt so much with how the waitstaff treated the customers....its more so the lack of professionalism towards each other IN FRONT of the customers. 

From what I could gather while listening to the wait staff complain to one another.... the hostess began telling customers that there was only room at the bar and sat pretty much every patron that entered the restaurant after 10pm at the bar. THIS PISSED THE BARTENDER OFF. He was clearly upset and even walked out of the restaurant at one point (don't worry,  he came back).  Buuuut to his credit...he did remain ""polite"" to the customers at the bar. It honestly just made us feel VERY uncomfortable. Like he literally tossed a bill book at a bunch of dishes almost causing them to fall into the floor. 
Since we already ordered we were kind of compelled to stay....afterall, the reviews of the food seemed great. And I will put this out there.... the bartender didn't seem like he was receiving any help from the other wait staff.... who were trying to ""close out"" their sections. 

Let me give another example as to how ""unprofessional"" the staff was while we were there. A waitress was clearly having issues with one of the men behind the bar. I guess she asked him a question (which I didn't hear) and when he proceeded to give her attitude...she responded with ""BITCH I JUST ASKED YOU A SIMPLE QUESTION"". I could see the patrons at the bars' reactions because of the big mirror pointed at them. Dear God it was getting super awkward at this point (still hadn't recieved food.) And yes,  the wait staff continuously spoke very hostile to each other...over patrons shoulders... during our stay. 

FINALLY THE FOOD COMES. And its ridiculously disappointing.  We got oysters (since it's an oyster bar) and I couldn't eat more than one.  It had the fishy-est taste....I pulled like 3 small pieces of shell out off my mouth,  and the breading on top had a mushy and  gooey texture (not baked to perfection like the menu described). And no,  GOOD oysters do not have an overtly fishy taste, especially if they've been cooked.

My fried shrimp platter tastes fishy as well.  The fries were good, but then again,  they're fries.... you really cant mess those up.  My BF got the tortellini,  which looked overly oily and tasted.....I guess cheap..... would be the best way of putting it.  

Our meal was over $70 and of course I left a 15% tip because I find it extremely unclassy to leave anything less.... the wait staff depends on good tips people!!! Remember that.  Unless they straight up spit in your food in front of you,  please dont leave the waitstaff nothing. But I digress....

Overall,  I can look past an ""ehh"" tasting meal.... but dealing with a VERY hostile wait staff,  made the whole experience pretty bad.  Like I said,  I know we all have our bad days,  but when you work in the customer service industry,  it's best not to let EVERYONE you're ""serving"" blatantly be able to tell your having a freaking terrible day.  

The curse of the Yelp expectation....I thought this was gonna be another great restaurant on me and my BFs trip,  but is the worst place we've gone to since getting here. Hopefully if you choose to go,  the wait staff has patched stuff up!

Ps: the reasoning for 2 stars instead of 1 is because I really don't wanna mess up the restaurant's rating and a 1 star review does.  Like I said in the beginning,  I just wanted to share my story not hate on the staff.",2019-10-31 12:55:45

We decided to sit at the bar and have a few drinks.  Jeffrey greeted us with a few food and drink suggestions which we ordered:
*Crab Claws ($13.50) - Amazing and a must order!  Tiny crab claws are served in a lemon garlic butter sauce and served with a few pieces of bread to soak up the sauce.   The crab claws were already cracked so it made it very easy to eat. This was the bf's favorite dish of the trip.
*Half dozen chargrilled oysters ($12) - So fresh and delicious!  Grilled oysters are topped with parmesan cheese and butter and served on a half shell.  My only gripe was that a few of the oysters were still a little sandy.  

Jeffrey was nice and welcoming.  He made sure we were situated with everything we needed.  The only downside was that they decided to clear one of the clogged pipes from the sand of the oysters which created a not so pleasant smell.  Definitely ruined the mood.

The don't take reservations, so plan accordingly.  If possible for dinner, request upstairs.  It is especially neat with they have the windows and doors open.

Recommendations for food:

Char-gilled Oysters: Excellent appetizers and a must when in NOLA.

Red Beans and Rice with Andouille Sausage: By far my favorite on the menu. It has some small breaded chicken strips as well that are amazing!

Taste of New Orleans: Yes, you can get this at nearly all the staple restaurants of NOLA.  However, in my opinion Royal House has one of the best representations of this dish.

The Taste of New Orleans is a must as well as the oysters. If you are there for brunch recommend ordering the Blood Mary. I am actually not a fan of Bloody Mary's but this one changed my mind. Out of all the places we ate on our trip to New Orleans this was by the far the #1 place I would go back to. Despite how full I was I literally could not stop eating. It was worth every single bite. We also split a Po Boy which was probably one of the best sandwhiches I have devoured.,2020-03-05 22:54:36

The only reason this place isn't getting 5 stars is because the Oysters Royal and Oysters Rockefeller were underwhelming. But the char grilled oysters were TO DIE FOR!

Don't waste your time with anything but the char grilled, they're spot on perfection!!!!",2017-07-07 21:55:28

For the entree, I had the shrimp platter and he had a fish po boy. Both were yummy and we'd return for the alligator bites if we are ever in the area again.",2018-09-04 20:37:43

First time here, we came when they first opened at 11a. It was not too big of restaurant but it was nicely decorated and they have an open tables to see outside. Seating was kinda tight though. Great service by Raven. The food was pretty good and one of the better ones in the French Quarter. She made her suggestions on beer and cocktails. Andygator beer was a good suggestion and was pretty good! The Avion Berry Rita cocktail was served in big glass and was very strong! You should try this too.

Of course, we had to try them chilled oysters and charbroiled oysters. Both were very good and oysters were not grainy with sand from the shell. We had French onion soup, redfish beignets, crawfish ravioli, alligator snacks, shrimp & grits, and shrimp creole. All very good but nothing spicy as I thought Cajun was supposed to carry a little heat? The redfish beignets was too breaded but fish was not overdone. It was sweet n tangy. I really liked the alligator bites appetizer as it tastes like chicken and was very moist. It was not a disappoint.

We did get the banana cheesecake and it was good and uniquely presented with crust in the shape of a triangle standing sideways. I thought it was round balls of ice cream but it was the banana cheesecake and also served with whip and fruits. You have to order this!

We ordered dessert the next night when we were craving dessert. We ordered more oysters and peel-n-eat shrimp. The shrimp was just ok. We ordered bread pudding and chocolate ala mode or something like that. Both desserts we're good but nothing special. Overall, 4.5 stars for me as this is one of the better restaurants here.

We were a group of five, we all order and when the food came out  two dishes were incorrect. One had the blackened Redfish with crab meat topping the other just Redfish grilled. When they came out one fish was blackened with crab meat but they gave it to the person that orderered just grilled, and the other person got just a redfish blackened. When this was pointed out, both dishes were taken back to the kitchen.
When the dishes returned, they had scraped the crab meat off on redfish meal and put it on the other . Keeping in mind both fish were blackened. Again we pointed out that the other fish was blackened and not grilled and that we could tell that the crab meat had been scraped off one fish to go on the other and he denied it. We gave him an out and he played the I didn't know the other fish was blackend too and denied the crab meat sitution, even though we could clealy see pieces of crab meat on the fish. Needless to say they finally fixed the sitution, reluctantly.

The Tast of New Orleans was yummy and the grilled and blackended redfish was good too. Just watch your food.",2012-07-14 05:07:49

I chose this restaurant based on Yelp reviews--- warning other yelpers--don't trust the 4 stars. First of all the service was lacking. The hospitality at Royal House was no where near the service at other NOLA restaurants. Second, the food was disgusting. Ordered quite a few dishes... across the board all were gross:
-Seafood stuffed mushrooms: the stuffing was rubbery. Not sure what was in it.....
-French onion soup: SALTY!! and THICK. I've never had french onion soup as thick as this one. Literally ate the cheese on top and tossed the rest.
- Taste of New Orleans (Jambalaya, Crawfish Etouffée and Chicken and Andouille Gumbo): Jambalaya was COLD. Crawfish etouffee rice was like instant rice just thrown on top. The WORST was by far the gumbo. It tasted like a chemical was dropped inside the bowl. We quickly spit it out. Tasted like rubbing alcohol. 
- ""Mashed garlic potatoes"": Unsure how this restaurant considers this dish mashed potatoes. They weren't even mashed... rather they were dried out and salty with some dried out cheese baked on top. 
AVIOD THIS PLACE. There are sooooo many other restaurants in the french quarters. Wasted $70 on this meal---literally all food was thrown out.",2020-03-02 01:14:28

This is the first time I've visited the French Quarters in New Orleans. After touring around the area, we came across this restaurant at the corner. We waited for 35 minutes to get a table, and it was a Wednesday.

It's a fairly long and narrow restaurant so seating was rather limited. Our table was placed on the edge, so my chair had 2 legs on the floor tiles of the restaurant, and 2 legs were on the actual sidewalk. I didn't mind it too much though, it was a unique experience.

After being seated, and ordered, we waited for another 45minute before we got our food. Probably because it was so jam-packed, and I don't expect their restaurant is big enough to serve quickly. But hats off to the waitress there. Knowing the food was coming out slow, she was constantly going around, checking on customers, apologizing, doing damage control, and making sure everyone felt taken care of. She also offered a free drink at the house cause of the delay. Which made the waiting bearable.

The three of us ordered a dozen of baked oysters to share and individual entries. I had the ""A Taste of New Orleans"" which was 3-4 sample size serving of different gumbo. I rarely eat Cajun food. To me, it was okay. Not completely in love with it, saucy rice? I think Cajun food does go well with beer though.  The baked oysters were nice. 

Enjoyed the atmosphere, and the positivity of their service.

A lot of the restaurants were closed so this was the place that we liked most (within walking distance from our hotel Omni) for oysters.  Most days they were excellent but the last day they were overcooked (see photos). We preferred the original chargrilled to the other choices. 

On the last day, we were happy to see that they opened early (see sign) because we needed to start our drive home to Texas and wanted one last plate of oysters. We walked up and Ada and staff told us that they weren't open even though the doors were open and the sign was out. So we stood there sweating and waiting but we didn't care all that much other than we didn't think it was great customer service. Not sure what that was about but it was a good send off especially because half of mine were overcooked. 

I would definitely check this place out and order the chargrilled oysters, they're fantastic.",2020-08-18 14:04:48

The server was friendly, but took a very long time to get our drinks. Not sure if she had to go work another section or what but there was only our table and one other one upstairs.

The food came out shortly after the drinks. Everything came out ok. I got some chargrilled oysters - they were alright. Also had the seafood pescatore - it was not bad flavor wise but could've used a little more pasta. Had I not ordered an appetizer (fried alligator - free with yelp check in when I did it) I probably would've still been hungry. 

My friend ordered the shrimp ""caprese"" salad and well, you can tell by the look on his face that there's nothing ""salad"" about it. They should really consider renaming this because it's misleading. 

All in all it's about what you'd expect I guess. No frills dining. The service could have been a little better.",2019-06-25 01:41:20

In order of what we liked (least to most) was: the red beans and rice, shrimp creole, gumbo, & the crawfish etouffée. All that said, our opinion of the place dropped quickly when we started seeing little roaches on the wall next to where I was sitting. I'm a Floridian and know how tough it can be to control that problem, but we saw at least three & this is the only place we had this happen in the 4 days we were around.
